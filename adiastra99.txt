I need more sleep 
why did you do this to me 
why are you up at 2am 
Gave a lecture I was super happy with, so by law I must now generally wander around feeling accomplished for the rest of the day 
I'm a second semester senior and I'm still being \"introduced\" to something in 2/5 of my classes 
also I'm really living up to my website bio rn 
Idk if it's got a name, but Munroe's Law has a nice ring to it 
Feel like personally I had it the other way around! 
I don't even know what that is, so that sounds exactly right 
Category theory is the closest branch of math to that \"statements dreamed up by the utterly DERANGED\" meme 
Welcome aboard! 
My entire feed is now and I couldn't be happier 
it's hyperbole! What better place for it than here? 
your 4-10 has 11 songs 
I just told an email thread of every MATLAB user at Berkeley they should switch to Julia and my purpose in life's basically complete now 
down for this 
making plots for my lab report, or making abstract art? 
Definitely not something I have to worry about 
i guess it's an 
hey this isn't sidbop 
In a way, having such a complicated set of projects all going in parallel is a success, because I didn't expect to get to this point until well into a PhD 
do white boys really need more time dedicated to them 
spring break fun\nthis is definitely what my custom type should be doing 
Twitter is my best source for home updates. \n(also, cats!!!) 
Using a CNN as an intro to coding sounds wild, I wrote part of one for a homework after I was a couple years into coding and still found it really hard 
gen z first learned that all systems would inevitably fail us when we read a series of unfortunate events 
The thing that jumps to mind is QM ladder operators - this is an infinite matrix, but if you were computing with it I'd rather just let raise(|n&gt;) = sqrt(n+1) * |n+1&gt; than deal with the matrix 
Are there use cases that are best served by an infinite-dimensional matrix/array object? I just came across a package implementing that, but can't think of where I'd rather use that than define my own computation rules outside of matrix math 
Oh, true - you could recover hidden states by printing or similar, but not if they're deleted. Now I wish I'd voted \"can't decide\" 
what is it tho 
ooh is this one of those things that's like the meme of \"astronomers think everything except hydrogen is a metal\" 
not sure why, but I was compelled to try this - GMDN is consistently lower than arithmetic mean for [1, ..., N]. Difference of about -6.43% by N = 100, which makes sense as the gap between AM and GM gets larger with increasing N 
36 seconds today, it'll be a good one 
I've run into this so much - I cry a single tear every time I make a list of lists just to flatten it immediately 
You? Impressing your friends' parents? Never

No one tell divergence 
somehow I doubt #rollestheorem is a trending hashtag 
pranshu what does this mean 
this thread is being crowdsourced by recent berkeley physics grads 
Love this! 
I guarantee I am the most respectable scientist! 
handover going well rn? 
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
Thank you! Hope I'll be able to visit the family soon! 
Thank you! I have passed the torch 
literally just spent half an hour doing this 
Personally for most of my classes I used PDFs - gets too expensive to actually own more than a few textbooks, even second hand 
perfect moment on the tl 
taking a booster vaccine but as a sleep aid 
yeah I was CBSE and that really killed it for me, esp the last two years of it 
oo what board were you 
\"web app\" + ratio 
ratio (the only rule is Sid is the only one who can get ratiod in this thread) 
look at me\ni'm the niche internet microcelebrity now 
you manifested it 
aren't we all just somebody in a skin suit 
:( get well soon! 
10/10 sop 
Like I wouldn't say I *hated* it personally, but it was my favourite thing till age 11-12 and then after age 18, and for those years in the middle I just lost any enjoyment for it. It was just something I had to do to pass exams 
I loved math as a kid, then lost it for about six years in school and only got it back in college! I'm still amazed that I fell out of love with it as hard as I did and I 100% think it's because of how it was taught - recipes for getting the right answer, no intuition, no beauty 
love that this reply is public but the original tweet is private so there's absolutely no context 
ah but you're failing to account for the rage-induced ritual burning of a small forest everyone does when they get really angry at how much spam email they're getting 
This made me look up this incredible moment again 
I used this so it was fun 
wait that counts as basic? Idt I've ever seen that 
Tbh this is what makes me feel like I've truly made it as an academic 
phrenology but make it girlboss 
oh minus the intent to do makeup tho 
same! I did apps and then botw 
interesting that she's been thinking about this for years then, I figured it was only a recent obsession bc \"the trans activists aren't letting me call them slurs on twitter :(\" 
SPEW is treated by the text as childish and \"they like being slaves, actually\" so wouldn't that suggest a negative view of SCUM as being small-minded/unrealistic? Albeit in a terribly executed way 
how's it connected to TERFism tho? Seems like just an equally terrible take on something different 
my best guess is it's rooted in the idea that a PhD = a single moment of inspiration/absolute genius that immediately gets acknowledged. Normal people can only manage 1 at most so these TV super geniuses must be N times smarter than the smartest person you've ever met 
in addition to why I'm wondering how - you'd have to be 55-60 or something and continually earning PhDs your whole adult life 
hyping up all my grad app drafts!!! 
also, my \"this is not phrenology\" t-shirt has people asking a lot of questions already answered by my shirt 
assigned female by app, the future is amazing 
I think it's the main messaging app used in China? Maybe it's a more reliable way to contact applicants who are there, does seem weird tho 
Yeah I think it's fairly common, I like it for formatting control + aesthetic

the best tweets are the ones that take a good ten minutes to line up in latex right 
\"how are applications going?\" 
I'd like it if there was a cap of like 5 classes you could put in - not sure there's any value to listing your textbook for intro calculus, bc if you've done more advanced stuff you clearly know that well anyway 
Isn't \"the extra 10% won't prevent that many deaths\" just false? NHS workers are in close contact with the most vulnerable people, and also they can and will bring covid home with them and then it goes to their kids' school and etc etc - it can spiral out easily 
To clarify I'm also not a python hater, I just think it's got some limitations/leaves you vulnerable to hammer-nail issues. V good as a general purpose hack language + some (most?) applications 
The comment that prefers Matlab to Python is just wild to me lol. I'm not the biggest Python fan myself but imo anything there is not to like about it is just objectively worse in Matlab, unless you're specifically using simulink 
Mine had almost nothing but the title 
Home Alone 2 
oh yeah I've heard great but horrifying things from friends (as in it's enjoyable but super difficult) 
good morning and good luck! what's it for? 
oo what'd you find 
Huh interesting, to me mainstacks is the more miserable one 
wait what's scary about moffitt 
I actually can't think of who we'll probably remember a century from now tbh. For the 20th century it's arguably Einstein and Hitler, so very possible (for better or worse) we don't know who that is for the 21st

what did you expect to happen in college if not this 
JWST is short for Jersey Wgeorge iSkander's Twitter 
*knocks on wood* \ni am simply trying my hardest not to think about it till it's done 
wait in american versions it's \"drug store\"? that feels so wrong to me, I've always read \"chemist's\" 
will your relationship announcement just be the lack of one of these tweets 
wait what are they lying about? 
I'm convinced python's lack of built in invariants (type checks, letting things fail at runtime, suppressing errors) has led to at least a few bad science results 
I guess you could say it's Im e^ikx summed from 1 to n 
oh god oh no I wish I hadn't done that 
we really are just iterating on the same four jokes over a period of months aren't we

True but the day to day utility of preponed is unparalleled. It's unique in that it filled a need that synonyms just can't 
yeah it's the best thing Indian English ever did 
Google what do you mean \"not many\". Why is it not none. 
what if I'm a passive follower 
i'm giving myself a preemptive 🌵 on this one and not dealing with it 
The T in JWST stands for Taylor's version 
Woah can you tell the TIME Person of the Year that? 
Did not even know that was a group that existed. This is more relevant on here every day 
Lmao and I thought my batch was bad 
today I both did and didn't send a message 
It's very in character isn't it 
it's pretty fun! took an enjoyable amount of brain and time to algorithmize what I was doing 
if anyone's interested, 
(yes there's both a Sudoku.jl and existing numerical algorithms out there, but I'm challenging myself to figure it out on my own) 
i made julia become as good at sudoku as i am! turns out a day of post grad-apps brain rot is all i can tolerate 
This is one of my fav pictures of me! It was one of my last days in Berkeley and I was selling my bike (just below frame) to a friend, who took the picture

Wait I looked ahead and I hate 30. Good to know what the question creators think of me wow 
i'd be lowkey worried about someone who was (that or they're just super open and that can be healthy ig) 
also wow they really put \"have you ever self harmed\" on there, and at 4

damn guess it made you look 
Does liking it move me up in consideration for inclusion on the list 
funny AND self affirming! this is my fav tweet of yours ever 
Oh yeah there's tons of computational ways but my challenge here is to only do steps a human would do

Love the idea that the NFT craze could be dismantled just by referring to completely unrelated things as NFTs 
i read this and just instinctively thought \"he's my witness\"\ni'm not even that much of a fan of the song 
Wait is the metaverse just worse minecraft 
here's what it's solving btw 
the generalizing code is admittedly pretty dumb, it just loops over all possible guesses till it finds one that solves the puzzle. In my defense that's probably the most human thing I could have it do 
good news: i think i'm solving general puzzles!\nbad news: most humans probably don't allocate 26.6 GB of memory to solving a Sudoku... 
hate that I'm so sorry :( but also what does \"space isn't real\" even MEAN 
Do it it's great 
lmao I feel this weird sense of solidarity at seeing you also get a ~50 follower bump off one tweet up to nearly 500 after I just did the same thing 
was the question \"what's the stupidest name for a famous person you can think of\" 
This implies we've already successfully avoided time travelling pirates during shipping, go us 
Found a UK survey that cites practical barriers as the 7th of 9 reasons why people are refusing it (no numbers, but I figure the ranking is an order of importance/frequency - wish I had something more concrete tho)  
I want to look for statistics on who vaccine refusers are to see if this holds any water, but can't imagine googling \"why are people refusing the vaccine\" will turn up anything useful lol 
i vaguely remember a bunch of stuff from thermo about canonical ensembles, what are those and how do they help us? 
astro twitter is going absolutely wild rn 
depending on how far back you wanna go for \"original\", this could be as far back as 2007 
c name reveal :o 
and therefore I just won't 
I don't even know where to start with this one 
I remember really early in the pandemic reading this from some right wing news site, and thinking it'd be really easy to clear up if they'd ever seen the difference between a first and second derivative 
Having done an iposter last year, I'd have *vastly* preferred just doing a 5-10 minute zoom talk over a slide deck, or a poster I could lay out in Illustrator and make available as a pdf 
How long's the flight?\nAlso what's a hobby/other thing you only started doing post march 2020 
yes the numbers may prove your point, but have you considered this slur I just called you 
rookie mistake, if you wanna be someone's friend you tell their upcoming tinder date about their twitter 
don't forget the lack of seasonal change in berkeley 
Wait I thought you already had an nsfw alt 
For some reason it really bugs me that they're just going ahead with aas240 in June instead of renaming that one to aas239. This way aas239 will never actually exist 
that would be the \"more or less\" 
I'm amazed that we've all more or less resolved this for charging tbh. I'm charging my phone with my Switch cable rn it's great 
do it you'll make 8 people's day 
whoops guess that makes me the first one to blink 
lmao I thought you knew that and were misreading on purpose for the bit 
Wooo congrats! What kinds of things will you be working on? 
I KNOW he saw this, it just didn't prompt the kind of self reflection that would've actually helped  
Diaspora parent standards transfer to twitter too huh 
critical... support? 
My mother has ~500x my followers and I live in constant fear of getting ratiod by her 
Ah gotcha 
ah so ig that lets you ignore the actually justifiable reasons to be mad like student debt and write it off as people complaining about smaller paychecks? (which would be valid if true) it's breaking my brain how little sense this makes 
wait what's even his point here? people will complain about the economy if their wages go down? like...yes? 
yeah I didn't think much of that bc it only ended up being one skipped week, but next term might do more of that unfortunately, we'll see ig 
isn't this a really sad way to spend your finite time on earth 
I found that super weird bc up to now they've been pretty good about safety and awareness - guess everyone in this country eventually falls victim to \"there's no pandemic because we can't be allowed to miss a second Christmas\" syndrome 
git rebase is evil and should never be used, I just tried to squash 5 commits and instead I made 5 more trying to fix what it did 
Werner von Braun was mentioned so this is obligatory 
it's one space telescope michael, what could it cost? $10 billion? 
so true 
I was 50/50 on mentioning it lol but I did go for it

I am in love with the phrase \"collective beautiful smooth mirrorboy son\" 
I'm obsessed with how the problem here is there's other places he would want to kiss himself in a mirror if only it were physically possible. Where. Why. 
Wait this sounds amazing as a tradition 
oh boy I can't wait to wake up to this one 
when* not it idk how that happened 
Oh it totally is, just that it's the kind of joke you'll get with almost all his posts and it wears thin quickly 
The issue's more it he uses his massive scicomm platform to be pedantic 24/7, people think that's what science is and that's at best a waste. Most physics/astro people I know don't have a problem with specific posts so much as his \"physics is for the annoying kid in class\" vibe 
I really thought doing gitlet would set me up for life but it was not to be 
I'm fine clogging my own repos with those bc the high commit count gives me a sense of achievement, but can see why you wouldn't wanna do it when working with others 
I see it as \"don't bug your collaborators with n commits that are all, like, fixing typos bc for clarity all of that should be in one commit\" 
I've chosen to never get around to it 
i hate to be the one to tell you this but it exists 
linear algebra has really been taking off in movies, ever since Tony Stark solved time travel using the eigenvalues of a Mobius strip 
also this conversation completely derailed our group chat 
I got curious about this and looked it up, and it turns out it's just a coincidence that even surprised Hilbert! (from the Wikipedia for spectral theory, and there's an article behind it) 
same but as grad student 
I thought I was the only one!!! 
I think it's more like short talk hours 
woah what brings you to the bay area? 
got chills when I realized Marion Zioncheck was a real guy and listened to it again 
tbh astro twitter could do with a little less stability 
why can't I be both 
you were talking about this a few months ago right? this is like my mini thread from then but 100x better 
wait how? I feel like this is one of those physicsy things where I'll go \"oh that makes sense\" but not challenge myself to understand it 
new album is going to be my driving soundtrack for months 
ew I'm so sorry anyone does that :(( 
tag yourself I'm San Jortland 
*vision meme* maybe i am a white woman 
I made a twitter bot to tweet out fake JWST acronyms every 3 hours! Check it out at done my best to purge it of any offensive words, but if there's anything you think should be taken down once it gets going, feel free to DM me! 
it is done! check out 
I'm kinda down to make this lol can I have IP permission 
wait doesn't one constraint supersede the other 
lol did you get it right, idt this ever came up in the aeross days 
lmao I replied at exactly the same time 
My has prepared me for this day 
Anyway I decided it's not worth the energy and I'd rather keep my feed relatively positive 
He did specifically say Einstein tho 
It is virtually impossible to guess the context here 
but I feel fairly good about my bet 
well even if not you, there's...others 
right on cue. i will merely say there is a lot of unrequited lesbian yearning on spitter these days 
ellen would read this, send me a screenshot, and go \"omg do you think they might like me\" 
i suddenly had the thought \"wait did it burn\" as I was drifting off to sleep, and I am not disappointed. Good omen for 2022 I hope 
are the D and C based on 90-100 A 80-90 B etc grading? 
Consistency is key when building a brand 
Omg I love talking about this: back in the day Anna had a \"10k tweets before 200 followers\" challenge (she didn't make it) 
No we want more 
did I accidentally make 3/26ths of a vocabulary bot 
new word for me! \"Tubicinate\" is apparently \"to blow a trumpet\" 
i just had a meal at 2:30pm that we all called breakfast so 
no idea what'll work until I hit something that does 
That is interesting, I'm not sure! I know when I'm solving by hand I have an intuitive sense for that \"tipping point\", so it sounds like it should be possible. I think it'd need a more sophisticated solution than guess-and-recurse though, as that strategy basically admits I have 
thanks! i spent a while on it lol, i started writing at 11pm thinking \"oh i'll just give it like an hour\" and oops now it's 6am 
I wrote up my process for how I made a Sudoku solver! It turned out to be a nice illustration of the many ways you can think through a computational problem, and how well-chosen structures can give you performance benefits! Read it here: 
this would also not be hard but i'll leave it to you lol 
imo that really is a win 
Hm ishaan I can't think of any of our friends that that reminds us of 🤔 
Well I've always learned best from your elaborate storytelling

hit tweet from about a year from now when the first jwst science papers come out 
I give it a week 
erasing the names of homophobes is a public service 😌 
It may also pick some obscure words, I couldn't remove all of those manually - I'll probably end up periodically purging the more nonsensical ones and maybe replacing them with more normal words as I find them 
it wasn't always this way - a few years ago it was pretty reasonable! There was a price hike I think roughly coincident with their IPO, which is also when they started treating drivers worse (Prop 22, etc) 
love the implication that all trans people are transphobic lmao. very good logic right there 
this is the usual regex progression

currently having a great time playing 1-minute chess games! I've never lost all my pieces this fast and still won 
weirdest one yet lol 
Yeah I think that's fair 
Mm fair enough, I guess that's just up to personal taste but I really like the direction it's taken this year 
I don't remember that one, was it this year? 
I guess there's some of that in making videos that are a digestible length meaning you have to drop some nuance, but it's never struck me as a real problem 
Wait wdym? I like her stuff and don't see that much repetition/reductionism 
not me tweeting this and immediately going \"omg a new notification on jelescope i wonder what it is\" 
on shameless self promotion and on 
Biking on MLK should be classified as an adventure sport, it's exhilarating and also deeply terrifying every time 
it's actually in there twice, because both \"jeans\" and \"weans\" are valid words! So it's at least (marginally) more likely than most others

lmao I think bart is more expensive than an Indian uber 
great way to waste, like, six hours 
Probably the best way methodically is to start reading up on advanced methods human Sudoku players use. That'll need some notion of \"partial conditioning\": either A or B, if A then C, if B then C, so C. These chains might be several steps long, maybe difficult to algorithmize 
to guess, I have an idea of which cells are more \"critical\" to the puzzle and which ones are less so, ie if I successfully identify *this* one, it's most likely to lead me to the rest, as opposed to just filling in one or two extra values. 
known to the app, that changes a bit because it means you can accept a guess for the first cell you try that with. A bit of intuition that I'm really not sure how to translate is - when I look at a puzzle where I've applied all the constraints I can and have to pick where 
If you've got something telling you when there's an error, the guessing part changes a bit - as I wrote it, it's possible to run through all the possibilities for a particular cell and not accept any of them because they don't give you the rest of the puzzle. With the solution 
one of the i4 by any chance? 
a weird one again! 
glasses! they really suit you 
it's fine this is a great one 
happy birthday!!! 
I searched my messenger out of curiosity and I found out we'd talked about it way back in the aeross days lol, apparently one of the proposal ideas I was kicking around was relocating JWST (not sure where to) 
ah I don't have a twitch rn so you're ahead of me anyway 
spitter chess gc wanna join? also down to play anna/you on stream sometime 
I agree with you but just because I really like waterfalls

I'm a big fan of the conspiracy theory that he's from an alternate reality where there's some musician we've never heard of, and he's the only person in this reality that remembers them so he's famous for passing off covers of their equivalent of the Beatles as his songs

Kirsten's new on there and she's got a ton of followers so maybe this is a bad metric lol

- graduated college\n- designed and taught a class\n- gave five science/computing talks\n- moved twice, once internationally (figuring out how to drive a uhaul along the way) and started a masters\n- experienced at least three things that can go wrong when you're driving a car 
Absolutely perfect then 
yay I can reset my nickname now!

nah Ellen's particular style is a special case 
by her standards yes 
oh we're back to subtlety 
and share all my biryani??? absolutely yes

You already know 
Gonna put myself in the running for this one

did you catch the Cheeseboard ref hehe 
just taught a 5 year old kid about aliasing, gotta get them started young 
Omg this is such a high honor 
This has such a pleasing musical kind of sound to it somehow 
this is like playing chess 
it's dz * 2, right? 
I witnessed this yesterday, can confirm it really is wild 
Just sarcasm bc SF Pride is dead this year apparently 
Great main event for SF Pride this year, complete with tickets starting at $25 (and mostly much more than that) 
gonna ask for the check by saying \":wq\" 
I get a lot of Americans making (light-hearted) fun of how I still say it! 
Renoux Falls sounds like a nice name actually 
The first thing I did on twitter was block him, and it's so much better this way 
I have high expectations from your apartment 
this is far beyond my understanding pls eli5 
let's say,,,hypothetically, that you had the chance to

Even now I'm using your network to make friends 
wait I can't believe I didn't try out \"a series of unfortunate events\" yet 
my brain also keeps going \"the haunting of hill house\"

Me too?? 
i realize this doesn't matter but it also does matter a great deal

any idea what happened in it? was it for kids? 
the adventures of sherlock holmes 
the story of tracy beaker 
\"community cheese\" sounds like monopoly 
good luck!!! you got this, lmk if i can help 
i wonder how correlated those two are 
tbh i was really hoping other people on your alt would get a laugh out of this lol 
ah nice so they do observe some things 
who's Jolyne lmao 
the what effect 
I like this! I'll try updating it to do that tomorrow 
No way, they made into a real thing 
march 2020 was truly the curse of knowledge 
Omg jelescope is on here 
Jelescope brought me in at second circle wow 
I love this! 
This is beautiful 
What's the song?

oo happy belated birthday! 
wait is it today? 
Oo I love this feeling! 
omg for once you're not caught up on anna lore 
i'm pretty sure this is it, not taking any criticism at this time 
uhhh ann arbor become leopard 
same re: sleep 
I'm also scrolling through goodreads and I think it'd be hilarious if she just went \"oh yeah it's that one!\" to something that is not even close to her criteria lmao, like \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" 
oh yeah they're incredible 
i'm literally on so many lists of classic books rn

Continuing my theme of \"ruining perfectly fun games by making computers solve them\", I wrote a Wordle solver! Post to follow at some point when I can figure out how to explain in a way that's not *handwaves* \"entropy!\"\n(this is from not the real puzzle!) 
Oh yeah maybe he's always like this, I've been blessed enough to not have had him on my radar much before 
He's really been quite the bad take machine lately lmao 
ha yes new update just dropped, even though it apparently misspelled \"solder\" or is using a word I don't know 
who gets bent out of what 
wait nvm there's no layers this happened on the book confusion post nvm me 
the *layers* to this 
JWST stands for JI'm sorry Wdave, i'm Safraid i can't do That 
Tbh not a bad first guess for coverage of common letters lmao 
dammit I forgot to save the update lol 
the dream lol, nah jelescope's on third 
omg me (I'm promoting this everywhere I can see lmao) 
here's the check summed over all queries where one character matches (either yellow or green) 
Depends on the query result, there's 125 possibilities and I'm not sure how to summarize them — but here's the same check as above for a zero-match on each! 
in action 
Oh I just did this! - it's kinda basic on the info theory, just maximizes entropy of [# green, # yellow, # black] summed over all letters, over all possible words 
by \"wholesome\" do you mean \"making holes in people's heads\" 
let's go 
this might not be a perfect metric but it does pretty well, it let me get today's in 3 
learning those actually gives you a lot of information, because eliminating those common consonants does a lot too! I just ran this and found that this case shrinks the possibilities from 9330 to 109 — and then you make another high-diff-entropy guess to narrow it down further 
I think it's still helpful to guess high-probability letters on the first go even if they don't come up green, because having them come up black also shrinks the candidate set significantly. Most words have an E or A in them, so knowing this one doesn't helps a lot 
I figured: for each character, each candidate word either has green, yellow, or black in that position, and the decision that gives you the most information is the one maximizing the entropy of the distribution [g, y, b] / (g + y + b) - loop over all letters, all words 
i actually calculated the word that maximizes the entropy difference and it's \"tares\"! (subject to some specifics in how it's calculated)

Jack alone probably won't be enough training data so here's an idea: like this if you want to opt in to a Spitter Bot! If you like it I will add all your tweets into the model (unless you later dm me to take it back, which is no problem) 
which is not to say I won't do it 🤔 
I think that might need GPT-3 lmao 
Not convinced James Winterkill wasn't a character on Game of Thrones 
This is the most realistic drafts check I've seen tbh. I can't fathom having full tweets ready to go and just not posted, but this? Perfection 
That'd be useful as a tiebreaker at the end, since before then we care about what gets the best splits instead of which word is more common (\"tares\" is p weird). For now though, there's no way for the program to know which word is more common so not sure how I'd implement that 
Idk what I mean by this, but that statement is always true 
Just Wild Stats on Twitter 
do it! 
I'm never not sad when I think about who she is and who she could've been if she just lashed out less 
oo I'd love to see how the hand tabulation works! 
computer says \"coaly\", but idk how human-like the subsequent chains of guesses would be! it'll be interesting to reason out how to choose certain features towards that 
it was one of the 13 colonies, but that's a bit outdated now 
cnew york it is then 
the city of new york? 
mildly disappointed they don't all alliterate but i love this list! 
for a second i was legitimately like \"what's a Dyson vacuum, is that when you build a Dyson sphere around a black hole\" 
being two people (derogatory (medical)) 
yeah till like 2 days ago they were! 
Nah that's by design, jelescope 2.0 is supposed to keep any one word from the real thing and randomize over the rest – it just seems to like keeping Webb and Space more than James and Telescope 
spitter recruitment strategy 
oops yeah lol I sent my first reply above saying something similar 
yeah, I figure this is mostly a limitation based on what candidate words a human can think of—for a computer it gets way easier after you eliminate a bunch of high-probability letters. (after you tested r and s, you rule out every word that has them, which is a lot!) 
Can't believe all that's standing between us and cold fusion is the marketing! 
I was about to suggest doing something with mount rushmore then I looked up their actual flag 
I think I'm old at heart then 
No just \"ellen, the one who fights god\", you're making a declarative statement about yourself not asking a question in the third person 
New screen name 
(slightly giving up subtlety in how bad I want PhD committees to notice me) 
This is actually one of the main things I wanna change about astro code: composability sucks in most cases and means you have to expend huge amounts of manual effort on code hacks instead of actual science. I'll try and make all my work super composable as a test case! 
Woman Denethor sounds interesting! How do you think that affected it? Like it becomes a sibling rivalry for a mother's approval instead of a father's, does that change how you read Boromir and Faramir throughout? 
I flipped my entropy criterion, filtered through some that are technically words but aren't really common, and came up with \"immix\", \"fuzzy\", \"whizz\", \"oxbow\", and \"kudzu\" as the top five — interested to see if there's ones that are worse for human guessing, though! 
don't make me tap the sign (search our dm for the 10+ times we've had this conversation about why that's a reductive view and not helpful) 
bay area time (and I'll be there at some point idk when!) 
consider your tweet funged 
for some reason this reminded me of the nine billion names of god 
wait are we back to the real jack 
submitting three grad apps today! 
So like, I've got the best word for one metric, but that might not always result in the easiest sequence of guesses, which is hard to quantify 
Yup! It's not an easy decision though — others have suggested that you don't want to use up all your really common letters early on if you're on hard mode, since the resulting high-probability guesses aren't easy for humans to think of 
I did some entropy calculations and it came up with \"tares\", which has worked pretty well for me! 
he should really go to some islands 
I'm going to get a good grade in covid test-taking, something that is both normal to want and possible to achieve, 
It's so weird to keep half an eye on jelescope, to mostly just check on it and see a bunch of posts with a few likes, then to see one on my timeline later because it inexplicably took off 
I'm never leaving the house again 
I'm ashamed bc I get it too 
yay we're good 
the stress when you're an international student who just ruined something and you're waiting for your parents to wake up to tell them is off the charts

oh this perspective comes from complete wilful ignorance I'm memeing 
as someone who's spent 4 years in Berkeley and like 4 days in other parts of CA: California has 2 regions, the bay and not the bay

thoughts on salted caramel? 
ooh this one is fun, anything I can read about it? I did a ton of reading about automated theorem provers once and then I looked at the code for one and was like nvm 
Go Bears! 
bear vs banana slug: who would win 
aw stop you're making me blush 
I'm experiencing this on a four year timescale with y'all. What do you mean you're applying to college you're 13 
I guess this could get worse? 
Dw I'm happy to keep being dumb to prove him wrong 
in that i consider many possibilities, and get outplayed anyway 
I'm gonna guess one of those these is Sandy bc it just sounds like an anglicization of an Indian name somehow 
yay trains 
Oh lol that makes more sense 
Much better, I figured you wouldn't like how \"left\" is north-up centric 
\"the left coast\" 
friendship ended with bay area, now san josen francisco is my best friend 
ah I thought you were in the train, that's better. Tell her I say hi 
the one thing that was better about summer 2020 
did it start again 
This is true, I'm amazed I managed it 7 times 
why would you do this to her 
my mother follows me on this platform 
ah, the Sugandese guy 
who's joe? 
and BART is now an interstate railway system 
I think this makes the Bay Bridge a state border lol 
that's not fit for twitter 
o o f 
lmao what'd they ask 
I just managed that thing where you close a box without tape just by putting every flap over every other one. This is my greatest achievement this year 
\"num-pie\" makes the most sense to me because \"numerical python\" 
wait I read \"best\" as \"bad\" and voted beans oh no 
why is this so dramatic 
this is way too niche to be real but i wish there were a ds9 extension in vscode. then I would have everything in one window for *maximum efficiency* (or just a really crowded screen) 
Oh hey you're back in the bay area wooo 
Sounds on brand for her too 
really want this thread to get to 51 
Ooh this is making me homesick 
where is dog beach?? I need this in my life

It's just, like, reverse psychology 
I mean that assumption isn't WRONG is it 
ah yes, a ploy to get 2 followers 
this sounds like a plan 
I'm at 158 followers and 329 tweets so doubt I'll succeed at this either 
noooo but yayyy 
ah so the challenge is to make posts that naturally drive people away, i see 
should I temporarily unfollow in solidarity with your mission 
That's fair yeah I'd be worried at that 
Also real answer to me is it's entertaining to have a character be that unpredictable and, not unhinged, but maybe only having half a hinge 
oh I made all my friends mad at me last summer when I watched ATLA for the first time, one episode a day for two months. (Gave me a sense of time during quarantine plus it was too good to let it be over that soon) 
Really listening to the lyrics of Three Lions and I love that one of the lines is \"thirty years of hurt never stopped me dreaming\". Only the English would put in a line acknowledging that they historically just haven't been very good 
can't believe you would watch Last Jedi straight after Force Awakens 
came to twitter and saw this bc my code just broke 
I think the real issue with this implementation is readability. This isn't very pythonic 
how did you make me, age 21, somehow feel old 
Wait explain that last bit 
maybe = lambda: np.random.choice([True, False]) 
love how cbse does a whole chapter teaching you the rules for matrix algebra with no linalg intuition (this encodes a transformation, determinant as scale factor, just why we care about any of it). I was so angry at it once I got to college and actually found out 
chaotic neutral: writing \\vec{E} by hand 
the fastest and most furious transform in the west 
I have no memory at all, so that's plausible 
Why did it take this person 24 points to say \"i voted leave\" 
but also i didn't see your tweet 
oh welcome back to twitter 
what if a swedish man was english

ok here's the formula \n(Part of the EM spectrum/something that sounds similar to it) + (white sounding last name) + (vaguely science word) 
the real move is to reverse this by starting to tweet about astro terms you just made up 
some sources will also say \"tilt (x)\" and \"tilt (y)\" which is so much better lmao 
they're complementary, one's up-down and one's left-right! Which is which is the question 
I know next to nothing about stars and galaxies 
ao isn't really a main astro topic so dw, that was more for the optics crowd 
Yeah these are the astronomer words for that - one is up-down and one is left-right, but which is which? 
I no longer know what either of these words mean. Someone's gonna ask me to tilt my computer screen and it'll send me into an existential crisis 
I'm multiple years into doing research in adaptive optics, and I've just spent an hour trying to figure out which one's tip and which one's tilt 
as a California resident who owns a glass Klein bottle this is extremely plausible 
aa this is so good!!!

Yes to both! We do have a tuk tuk thai but also there's a michelin starred restaurant I've never tried and have ~2 months to finally go to 
i know this is a tweet about Dartmouth but i also perfectly identify with it as a Berkeley tweet somehow? 
however, i can reactivate long-forgotten knowledge and look at OpenRockets! 
i've been trying to L1 for literally two years but i'm bad at building things with my hands :( 
we need a hashtag that is not also being used for astrology lmao 
#AstroTwitter - what's your process when you sit down to write code? SWE (or at least my data structures class) uses design documents, and I'm wondering if we have something similar for the purpose of open-source astro analysis/simulation code - or if we could make it! 
oh yeah lol i might as well ask it 
I wanted to ask an astronomy question but wasn't sure of the hashtag to use, so I checked out #astrotwitter only to find it's mostly astrology lol 
this is \"motorway\" erasure 
I've heard \"the #\" is a socal thing, I've spent all of a week in socal ever and yet I say it

I was running an accelerometer app on my phone, let it fall from one hand to another and noticed it only spiked on impact, and realized I'd invented the dumbest ever test of Einstein's equivalence principle 
can't believe this tweet was the day before \"you need to be smart to be an astrophysicist\" 
True, I considered myself part of that category - a year ago I wouldn't have given this email a second thought. It's really only because of the debate around people's park that I've started paying attention to it 
Yeah I figured it was a mix of the people's park issue, and proving they're necessary in general so they're immune from being defunded in the most left-wing city in America 
wonder if ucpd is at all motivated to artificially inflate crime stats rn. can't think of a single reason 
So if there's no weapons, no injuries, no threat of violence, why is the subject \"violent crime\"? And why does it claim to be both an attempted robbery and a robbery within two lines of each other?

The \"why are you risking your phone to see 100-year-old science\" spike 
as an astrophysicist, I am smart enough to break my phone for science 
told ya 
but also, valid 
wait there isn't even any code in this, this is an actually good one 
wait i just realized this is the inspection paradox striking 
there's also a selection bias where you're more likely to hear \"I love everything about space\" from the people who love everything about space, and nothing from the rest 
that's totally valid! Maybe it's because academia's so intense that it encourages, like, \"you have to be maniacal about your love for this to do it\" 
I kinda feel this! I come at astronomy from a very \"this is a source of cool problems I'd like to solve\" perspective, which I think is valid but often isn't as...intense as some of my friends who just love space for space 
I do love the print(\"yeet\", ...) tho 
my soul has been hurt 
consider yourself appreciated 
too late 
I'll leave it up to your opinion

no you're amazing at it! 
nah that'd only happen if *I* gained 200 followers

all my berkeley friends just groaned bc this is like 80% of my personality 
can I interest you in Julia 
nooo :( fingers crossed for you! 
look sometimes you make tweets that are just for yourself

white, but the same is true in reverse probably 
my happiest academic memory was the three weeks in summer 2019 when no one was on campus and i claimed the whiteboard there for the entire time 
I agree with this person on one thing: there is no need to make math this stupidly frustrating 
:( if it's any consolation I tried to wake up early to go biking this morning and ended up waking up even later than usual 
it's us! 
ew imagine being str*ight 
pls fund 
I did that a fair amount today and did most of it, it's starting that's rough 
I need to figure out a creative set of paths down 
I totally would! But there's little bits that aren't fully downhill 
Science is important, but my real accomplishment this summer will be if I can bike all the way down the UCSC campus without ever pedalling 
oh that'd be recall Guptae wouldn't it. Not as fun 
hope you win the write in campaign so we can all recall Kavie 
can i come and just, like, shake my head in the corner from time to time 
as long as they're not set up like this one: searched \"tom scott oh no\" to get this) 
this summer's the first time i've been dumb while coding using a lab computer connected to hardware, it's consistently terrifying 
Is this inspired by recent posts from 
don't tell me what to do 
oh this one IS a hot take, when would you say america became a democracy? Voting Rights Act? 
on a more serious note I can't believe the choice for these people is \"pay for an entire college degree\" vs \"go high up in a plane one time\" 
hey do you wanna invest in my new startup Chad Aerospace 
the virgin galactic vs the chad [the rest of this tweet is on hold pending the creation of a good private space company] 
anyone wanna send me one of those helmet webcams for, uh, science 
Think I found the optimal route! I had to brake for a car in front of me unfortunately so I had to pedal a couple times today, but it's doable! 
go on the roof of Campbell! it's so good there! 
i can't object to that but I'm not happy about it 
ok cancelling you for that pluralization of terf 
I've actually only ever heard \"dudes rock\" said ironically 
or India 
Most days I'd push back on this and defend Julia, but today I'm facing 
the new update is so good! I used to find package imports with it really difficult and now they're so nice 
love Julia rn but I can't wait to use it in a few years when these kinds of things are quicker fixes/don't come up at all 
ok this was a meme but I just spent 45 minutes on something in Plots not building 
but also I would absolutely think \"she's made of fluff. she'll never be enough\" was just one of your regular tweets

I just met (had a meal with and talked to in depth) 14 people over 5 events in 2 days. Having introvert impostor syndrome 
lmao we accidentally synchronized our twitter breaks 
just be unhinged! it's great 
counterpoint: \"a tensor is something that transforms like a tensor\" is a great meme 
ahh I'm leaving soon too and already know I'm gonna miss it so much! 
whoops let's just call that even 
smh notice when you're being subtweeted 
haven't really seen anyone tweeting about the beach that makes you old today. feels like an untapped source of comedy 
I'd like to imagine you just know that list off the top of your head for the other 48 states too 
100% of the people I know in Michigan work for the car industry, and I'm sure he would back me up on this! 
you've fully deprofessionalized my account at this point 
the in between is just being online about as much as you are so not even needing notifications 
where's \"I have no clue but just wanna be included\" 
that'd do it 
wait we have cool parties?? no one ever told me... 
hi yes i want to do a phd in computational paleontology 
Borrowed a reference book from my advisor today to help with the script! 
this just in: the New York Times doesn't know what \"interstellar\" means 
Yes I do want to check out Rust! I've heard good things 
Oh that's great, thank you! 
The simulation and the book look so cool! Do issues ever come up in Javascript with not having numerical utilities? Eg all the numpy/scipy functions? 
Ooh good to know, thanks! 
Yup I think I'm good w pandas! My objective here is more something that'd be fun to learn, or that'd give me more insight into the low level 
not currently, but it could happen - I figure python/Julia/general big project experience would cover me for that? 
oo great idea! I had a class a couple years ago that used a little SQL but I don't really know it now so I should totally do that! 
ok you were memeing but making a website is actually a key science thing so ty 
I'll look into it! 
Julia covers the MATLAB use cases and is open source! Have vaguely heard of Haskell but don't know a lot about it, are there any advantages to functional languages for researchy tasks? 
Fortran seems scary though which is why I've got Julia already 
Has anyone used a programming language other than Python, Julia, or C++ that they'd recommend for science? Thinking of learning one for fun/programming skill/weird science edge cases, and am not sure how to pick 
it's called wingmanning anna 
because you just tweeted about it: calculus of variations 
what helps me is to write, like, one line and say I'll fix the *rest* later! It's easier to get back into it once you've got a starting point already done for you 
you tweet it and trust he'll be perpetually online 
I saw that name on a news website and was immediately like \"lmao some journalist heard a TF bit and thought it was real\" 
I've wanted to get into hardware for a while! I've found it a bit harder to understand than software though and haven't been able to commit to getting myself over the hump, but I'm hoping to! 
not quite at grad school yet but !!! 
you're great at conversation! 
I've used it for classes and like it - not sure how it'd scale up for big projects though? I feel like it'd be nice to have a bit more structure/control, but maybe it provides that with functionality I haven't come across yet! 
I will happily evangelize Julia to anyone who'll listen! Give it a shot, it borrows a lot of syntax from both MATLAB and Python so should be familiar if you've used those 
I've been using Julia for about a year now and I'm still finding new features! Thanks for sharing! 
Of course - just wondering what tools might be useful to have in the box for later! 
Yeah I've heard horror stories from friends, hoping Python/Julia cover me for those uses 
Fortran is the #1 answer on this thread! 
I've heard of ROOT, understood it as being mostly for particle physics? 
This looks so cool, thanks for sharing! 
I've used MATLAB for classes before! Switched over to Julia for all of its use cases pretty much though, as it's faster and open-source 
I saw some demos elsewhere in the replies of Javascript in-browser simulations, that seems really fun! 
I didn't know there was a difference between them, what is it exactly? 
I like this idea! I've always sort of made up whatever I do in the shell/glued it together with many stackoverflow threads, so knowing what's actually going on sounds great! 
I'm looking for something other than those three - I know Python and Julia already and am aware of C++ as another natural choice. Just wondering what else might be fun and useful to pick up! 
Same question for homoiconicity, how fundamental is it/where would you say it comes up? 
Is the idea of Haskell mostly pedagogical, i.e. just because it's worth seeing/working in a purely-functional language once, or are there tasks that it's better suited to? (I'm interested in looking into it either way! Just curious) 
Yes it's pretty common! Helps you make a record of your academic work that isn't dependent on your name, affiliation, etc staying the same over time 
Wait how do you trick anyone with this twice? 
this barely even qualifies as a joke i'm tired 
it stands for cdont tread on me 
And we've got the 3000 IQ play of just never leaving school! Perfect 
I once got a coffee cup back with \"Aam\" written on it and was just like...how even 
Wait that starts at our age?? Scared now 
The one annoyance is glasses fogging up but I'll still do it ofc 
excuse you git i'll make my commit messages as long as i like 
it's even missing an apostrophe. Truly no demographic left unappalled 
oh NO. this is terrible, which I guess here means excellent 
criminally underrated I agree 
ah yes, a zoomer 
fashionable olive gamer 
fine I'll get out of bed 
can't believe you don't respect my mom :( 
how dare you be entirely accurate 
wait ishaan if you're mentally unstable, what are the rest of us?? 
Does having Zoom running at the same time as your code slow it down, or should I be worried that everything's broken for my lecture tonight? 
I feel attacked 
why aren't we both asleep rn 
I call this one \"Squid in Abstract\" 
I feel this :( I honestly think it's so person-specific that it's hard/impossible to say what we're \"missing\" - decent chance it's absolutely nothing. (I don't know if that's better or worse, but at the very least not worth blaming ourselves over) 
] resolve in Julia is just me telling it \"make it make sense\" 
I'm so honored 
Does anyone know of a guide to making effective plots for physics/any academia (posters and papers)? Beyond just syntax: choosing what to plot, what kind of plot to make based on data, how to effectively communicate your point, etc. 
but also ouch i'm sorry 
Tbh this gives me hope that the machines have yet to take over 
I buy it, time to watch at 0.5x to be done in 45 mins 
I have no idea how, but a 1.5 hour lecture at 2x always ends up taking 3 hours to watch 
i knew this would be the image as soon as I saw the caption 
Wow you're just straight up publicly shaming your group huh 
big fan of this look 
I don't hear it a lot on the west coast, but it's def a thing/fine to say! I hear \"no problem\" more as a response to \"thank you\" 
lol sorry I've just been in berkeley way too long. the rest of the world? what's that? 
10/10 choice 
THAT'S MEZZO I WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ANYWHERE 
i want to say something appreciating this but I know how you'll respond to it 
*expectation, not density! 
Redoing it from scratch with that same idea, I got a density of 2D/pi actually! If that's also wrong chalk it up to doing math in transit 
I think it's an arcsine(0, D) which would give an expectation of D/2, but am on my phone so will try the change of vars/expectation integral later! Although I'm skeptical of a numerical answer that's that simple... 
WLOG choose the first point (say 6 on a clock), then the randomness comes down to a choice of the angle made by the chord and the tangent line to the first point. That's theta ~ U[0, pi] and the length should be D sin theta, so an arcsine distribution? 
My Bluetooth earphones broke recently and I'm worried about doing this to someone else so now I simply suffer 
Yeah a lot more interesting information than I was really expecting! It became too much for me to keep up with pretty fast 
you've got what now 
do it for me, whose l1 is gonna have to stay in storage for 8 months before I fly it :( 
live your dreams 
Coincidentally \"old man yells at cloud\" is also basically what AO is 
every time I hear about a cat doing something like this I remember catsitting over summer 2020 and sending this text 
My hs uniform included a white shirt and I def had at least one that was closer to pink 
+1 I do this in India and not here 
what's wrong with butter?? As a proud half-Punjabi I say butter goes on absolutely everything 
having never seen this show before I'm incredibly entertained by this running commentary 
hopefully mine won't be delayed 14 years 
this tweet was made purely for 
flying a mini jwst as an L1 payload just so that some version of it ever gets off the ground 
damn hope you see it soon 😔😔😔 
have you seen anything yet 
(correctly, but still) 
you underestimate me anna 
For research I use the very general term \"scientific computing\", but that covers both data-driven science and more \"pure\" simulation - I'd also like a term that specifies non-simulation scicomp! 
honey bad?? this should be in your hot takes thread smh 
your hair looks great 
just stare at her and trust that she'll wanna fill the silence 
Huh good to know 
I'm an expert in watching a 15m video and feeling like a pro at analyzing chess positions, and then switching over to lichess puzzles and immediately hanging my queen 
can't believe that is literally true 
I agree with this - I've tried to learn category theory as an abstract idea before and never really followed it, hoping that when I come at it with a better foundation/more possible concrete examples, I'll understand more of it! 
if you got enough of them you could even put them all together chronologically, in a line sorted by time. that'd be sick 
join the google photos! 
Oh I hadn't read this in a while, \"remove speeding laws but only for bikes\" is incredible 
where's your recall election platform again? Trying to promote your campaign 
Wild, good to know 
so who won

*stares in universal healthcare* 
I was shocked when I found out highway 1, less than an hour out from the Bay, had no service all the way down! Even more shocked when I found my car wouldn't start bc it needed data... 
this is becoming the catchphrase! 
this is not an in-front-of-a-dome one but that'll come soon! 
still in the car lol but here's one I dug up from 2017 (I was such a baby) 
oo I'm gonna have one of these in a few hours 👀 
ucpd really said \"gaslight gatekeep girlboss\" 
for context 
I think this one's an Anna original! Great minds think alike 
it's just missing the \"laminar\" 
and a good lab system calls for quick code! (future phd advisors please note i love writing good quality code) 
the really viral write-in campaign 
Nice! I was lucky enough to be able to visit him just before the pandemic - he was thrilled to meet a \"real mathematician\" (I was fumbling through a manifolds class at the time). Don't have my bottle to hand, but I do have my sticker! 
is that a Cliff Stoll original Klein bottle on the top shelf?? 
\"never check message horses\" sounds like a mnemonic for something 
on the other hand, simulations can make you miserable 24/7! 
The curse of working with real life lab equipment is somehow you can only get it working the way you want to when it's 4:30pm on a Friday 
wait so what does he think \"you'll see 1984 won't be like 1984\" means 
at least we've still got 
yeah this about checks out, except irl you're not like MEAN mean just fun mean 
tbh \"gives other people a conversation starter\" would be a con for me 
Oh yeah do it out of the power trip of being able to reject them for a change 
yeah honestly you're probably better off... I'm 50/50 on even reapplying there personally 
Yeah but I care 
does this place begin with a c 
can't believe you would cancel Tatooine like this 
there's Tom Scott's one that you've probably seen before - 
similar to question - what first got you interested in space and what kept you motivated to keep studying it? 
I could've picked something simpler like category theory 
Fourier optics is so much more complicated than I remember why did I choose to do a video on this 
the tweet doesn't quite reflect the headline here - generally I'm seeing a sudden shift from \"it's not really happening\" to \"it's happening and there's nothing we can do\" which is disconcerting 
the accent is wild (veers drastically from American style Rs to British Ts to the odd word you would only say in Indian English) but it's nice overall! 
huh i don't hate the sound of my own voice 
only somewhat related, but I'll never pass up an opportunity to quote Lucille Bluth 
woah when'd you go to minnesota 
Is that a trans flag zebra crossing 
guy who loves orange juice in cereal but he's also the personified Subway from Community so he can't vote for that one 
No good reason, just couldn't get to sleep and not sure why 
True! (That's just because it's past 2am..) 
\"heaten godchild\" would be a fun addition to my bio 
yes but *despite* this not because of it 
what really is the difference when you get down to it 
know your place 
Wait that sounds so cool! How does that work? Do you have a combined thesis that works for both, or is it like doing two PhDs at once? 
I did not in fact have to curse my hubris in this case! That's happening now 
Sometimes I do, but making them *overly* descriptive is good fun 
tbh since you're named \"worm food\", this person actually upgraded you 
git appreciation post, I just recovered from none of my code working in a meeting by rolling back to last friday's version 
no the bit is that I use julia and for some reason Ishaan decided that was Italian 
love that liked this without even knowing the bit 
yeah smh my culture's being erased 
that doesn't even 
this is a new one, what IS Steve Jobs 
no dw i already know you're not i meant the others

Oh nvm saw the next draft 
I'm desperate to know what Desantis is

Thanks to covid I've been in California continuously for 2 years, which is longer than anywhere else I've ever been, so that's gotta count for something 
I voted CA and then realized I just legitimately forgot that I'm not from here lmao 
It's been so much fun working with Pedro and all the other Lamat fellows this summer! Thanks so much to and for making all this possible!

ok this got me reading the rest of the thread and this one is terrifying 
yeah us meeting is, like, the distant past now

DRAG HIM 
getting a phd in managing paths to load and save data 
I've only been there 10 weeks but same 
this took me a minute but now I'm dying lmaoooo 
I think Overleaf has a GitHub linkup too so I bet you could have it auto-commit and push all your figures 
Oo cool I should do that 
Some of that is pandemic vs a mostly in-person summer just now, but it's crazy how much framing the motivation did for me 
I feel this so much in science! I've done so much better this summer when I've been like \"I really want to get this thing working\" than last summer when I was like \"oh no I'm falling behind and won't be done in time for grad apps\" 
no see physics is the only search for truth and therefore no other academic fields exist or are valid and- *i am killed by a chemist who heard astronomers call carbon a metal* 
Oo what does this do? Is it like a tex compile function 
\"thinking of\" 
I've seen that measuring CMB anisotropies has been really important recently, but what do they tell us? ie how would a cosmologist go from that information to some inference about large scale structure, history, etc?

You mean your last bit of free time till 2026? 
Selling my bike feels more emotional than saying goodbye to any of my friends did 
damn do you know any 
sounds like it! 
!!!! let's GO 
lmao I do not envy you 
My take is the climate problem is big and multifaceted, and not all of us are going to help by creating better solar cells. Solving climate needs good scicomm so we can get everyone to buy into solutions, and astro being a \"gateway science\" means we excel at that! 
how dare you be, like, 40% accurate to me 
I could've written this exact thread - right down to \"trying to graduate on time with a double major\". 0/10 in astro PhDs here, and I totally agree that it's really hard not to take personally 
binging Tom Scott's entire channel has lasted me a while 
james webb                  personal rocketry\n                        🤝\n     taking way too long to reach L2 
I'm a month from graduating college and I don't think I've come of age yet... 
anecdotally I've heard yes - I've been told by a student who's gone from the masters I'm heading into to an astro PhD that it can take a year off coursework! 
Some European PhDs will take US bachelors actually! In the UK at least, bachelors degrees are 3 years w/ usually no research, so their bachelors + masters = a US bachelor 
the one I'm skeptical of here is peanut butter and hot sauce 
i have definitely never paired peanut butter and eggs 
if you don't count as space twitter, no one does 
Congratulations! I'll be attending the MASt in Applied Mathematics preparing for astrophysics PhDs, so I'll see you there! 
oh look it's 
where's the option for those of us who've been here from the start :( 
eat the rich, where rich starts at $1 above the sf median income 
good thing he didn't go into a career that involves a lot of formal and hard math then! 
hope They see this 
this is only the beginning, watch as \"submissive and breedable\" makes its way into Emily in Paris S2

to clarify: 3blue1brown is running a contest for math explainer content that i was gonna submit a video to lol 
The 3b1b video isn't happening :( I'll still make it at some point, just won't be able to in time - had too much research stuff come up 
Planning on trying this out tonight! 
hey kansas stole my 
I'm sure everyone in the Lamat office would be thrilled though :) 
I just saw an actual recall ballot and tbh if you'd officially declared you'd get, like, thousands of votes lmao 
oh no anna are you trying to straightpost 
Yay good luck!!! 
nah it's functional programming scope rules, local scope first 
Happens to all of us 
wait this just made me realize i have no idea why it's true 
i'll freely admit that was bait tbh 
something something central limit theorem 
I try not to talk TOO much about Julia being the superior language, but sometimes you just can't not 
Me always 
at some point don't the \"unusually high call volumes\" become usual

love getting my (2^32-1)th vaccine 
You should try it starting from Emeryville! There is an actual path but only up to yerba buena annoyingly - still nice views and nice ride back down 
If you're heading up to Berkeley, you came across my least favorite part about biking in the bay area: the bay bridge only having HALF a bike path 
time for cinnamon to be unleashed? 
I guess I'm being a bit harsh on it - it's not that bad, it's just no total eclipse 
Golden Bear Orientation! It's the week of events Cal puts on to introduce you to campus/show you around 
Yeah I guess we were the year to find out that GBO is overrated 
And I was up at LHS, so gorgeous setting with zero visibility 
No I remember it super clearly! One of my friends skipped two days of GBO to go to Oregon to go see it and I was all :O that's illegal 
Wanting better visibility on that day is my adaptive optics origin story 
It was my college orientation week! We got the best view of...the clouds

I have hopefully fled the land of tech bros but will absolutely still promote the cause

I just flew in today! I have no idea what I'm doing yet either 
Okay this is more like 15 minutes, not bad but I'm still kinda mad 
love when I randomly get put in an hour long queue in a country where I'm a citizen 
he post on my timeline and it feel george 
yeah I was too lazy to screenshot so that's the afternoon sf sun doing its thing 
I googled it and was like \"I can't believe this is reality\" 
about to have a one-minute-long existential crisis 
I guess it still feels a bit too much like symbol-pushing though - I'd want a geometric reason to complement this one 
That is pretty algebraically neat! Sort of the extension of (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab 
this looks like an album cover for, like, Russian indie rap 
This is just half of Inside isn't it 
This was one of the great culture shocks coming the other direction 
euler's identity is probably a pretty quick route to the algebra yeah but that doesn't feel super satisfying yknow 
i guess I'd like something more geometric? like an argument based on sin = opp/hyp etc 
I've known it for years how have I never questioned it 
Lmk if you find out, WarnMe is the one thing that Google Voice is doing for me rn 
truly no choice 
ahh that's the one bay area thing I never got around to, have fun!!! 
oh hey Rahul, neat 
I'm down tbh 
It's open! 
Puzzle wine - solve to open! I sent this to some friends and currently \"break it\" is winning over actual solving suggestions 
tag yourself I'm \"high degree of innovativeness\" 
but also I assume this is a number of users thing and Julia won't be there for a few years 
hush don't attack me like this 
Like, who ever thought that was a thing 
Sure, but why is \"JavaScript supremacy is dead\" the headline lmao 
no way 
Wait all I can find is performance reviews, what are both the meanings you're seeing 
I had this exact experience the first 24h I was looking after a cat! He still hated me so I figured he'd run off - found out he hadn't when his food dish was emptied overnight, then middle of the next day I found him just casually staring back at me from my closet

Geronimo the alpaca on speed 
Saw this on here earlier today 
wait also a sincere one: what do you think is an underrated factor in choosing PhD programs to apply to/attend 
what two adjectives beginning with s and b respectively would you use to describe yourself 
Curricula help but don't give all the info - you wouldn't be able to find out EP flexibility via the website, because I got most of my leeway from additional petitions 
good thing I'm terminally online!! 
for example: def recommend Berkeley EP bc it's super flexible and also easier to get into, you can always add an EECS minor/major or even switch when you're here/just take all the classes you want from EECS as an EP 
okay my take is ask people at as many places as you can on your list (1) how easy to get into (2) how cross disciplinary all the majors you're considering are 
huh I learned a new word 
Damn can't believe you have straight men followers

my school in India just had us start and end an hour later in the winter, no idea why the rest of the world can't just do that 
what are the candidates 
as a Julia evangelist I am here for the python ban, but the telescope ban kills most things I would use Julia for 🤔 
at what point in your academic career do you become confident that your email phrasing isn't terrible 
(this is bait for anna) 
paradox alert 
damn it 
Checks out 
Those may not be high priorities for you tho, you could probably do that through family numbers that are still in the US 
Yeah but then you can't keep your number for stuff like bank verification (gets really annoying internationally) + you can't have WhatsApp on your local number without a second device 
get Google Voice! Keeps your number and lets you call and text on it indefinitely for a one time $20 fee 
the one thing i internalized from my manifolds class was \"i can't believe it's actually called that\" 
gonna interpret this as being pro trans rights in academia 
that's totally it!

ah the berkeley cs freshmen have arrived 
airbears2 is...not high on the list of things I miss about berkeley 
Ooo what are you teaching is it 7A? 
I was in the shower! 
I had a friend once who never swore except for one time when she REALLY wanted emphasis. It's been six years and I haven't forgotten it 
update: got pdf dark mode up for the full Coder Aesthetic(TM) even when I'm just writing 
just finally linked Overleaf and Github, meaning I can officially do absolutely everything in vscode. This feels so powerful 
fine, I'll pay the $500k 
I think it's a tragedy when one of these doesn't land and am happy to take an L once in a while to avoid that 
wow a new one! 
What a ratio 
(to the tune of video killed the radio star) 
damn you didn't need to go so hard 
Are you allowed to share course content? I wanna see these examples 
ah, Alexander Hamiltoad 
You're on private anyway dw 
woooo congrats!!! Who was the senior I'll fight him 
also seems like a good time to plug my own class, 
this is v similar and cool to check out! A lot of research is dealing w this stuff and it's rarely taught in a structured manner 
grad schools pls accept me in part to do this 
I love the 3blue1brown on this that I linked separately here 
tldr is it's basically the property of the Fourier transform where if you stretch in time you contract in frequency or vice versa! For example: closer to a sinusoid (wide in time) you are, the closer to just a single peak in frequency 
also obligatory relevant 3b1b 
I first learned it in a signal processing class! Helped me so much when I got to it in QM, it felt familiar and intuitive there 
How did I never know you could do f' for autodiff this is life changing 
Idk I'm 3-4 years into this and still make up all my optics/signals knowledge lol 
Yeah fourier intensity would probably speak more to sinusoid type trends in the original image which aren't really present here I guess 
But no this is correct, surprisingly 
Yeah I was surprised by that, apparently phase matters more than magnitude here. Something something Fourier duality 
Saw this in a paper and decided to try it for myself - take two images, Fourier transform them, swap their phases, Fourier transform back! A quick way to see how important phase retrieval is 
wait I thought we were Spitter 
As an astrophysicist didn't you unfollow the periodic table except for hydrogen and helium already anyway 
why is updating pip the most common thing i have to do with pip 
Hi I went to middle/high school in India if that's close to what you mean! High school is when I got interested in astro careers so might count for something 
that is a perfectly timed laugh 
Hi so I stretched the def of \"tonight\" a bit but I really like it! Could you open DMs/lmk how else to contact you for a couple quick comments if you're open to that? 
Left my room prompted by this, and she goes \"all art is not reflective of life but is merely inspired by life\". Okay so am I making breakfast or not 
Also not a teenager any more, not that that helps my case much 
Oo ok let them(?) know it was excellent 
yeah can i get a uhhhh natural stone 
In between Berkeley and Cambridge rn! 
Gendered clothing norms are temporary but deals are forever 
I'm assuming they have a good selection of men's stuff too but tbh idec if they don't 
Where even is this. are you telling me I could've gotten a whole new wardrobe for like $60 within like half an hour of where I lived for 4 years 
I legitimately laughed out loud 
awww ❤️ 
second circle?? I must step up my game 
but also it took a few thousand lines of code to get those files so your point's valid 
Okay that was an scp, it was just a ton of file names as they were being copied 
Am I being subtweeted 
Nooo tragic 
nice! Three things for 24 sounds even better to me tbh 
I entered the pandemic with only one pair and was constantly terrified of this 
11 is so good for that 
also if I know anyone with Julia experience, lmk if you know how to get Pluto -&gt; HTML posts loading faster! This is 20MB and it shows lol 
I expanded this into a little blog post/article thing! 
I had good intuition for it at one point, will try and rediscover it and get back to you 
Bio update pls 
I don't even know what I meant 
(ive had a bit of wine) 
paper day is stored in the balls 
Appropriate for Newton then! (As rumor has it, at least) 
Oo I just noticed the sleeves this looks kinda indian! Like someone took a bit of a sari or something and upcycled it into its own top, I'm a fan 
this is the thrift acquisition right 
v clear language and diagrams, it's cool 
fair enough, it's actually surprisingly accessible to modern day readers 
I like this more than Bennett's Optics for sure 
Picked up a copy of the oldest optics reference book there is at Cambridge! 
Ah I was fully expecting some variation on \"1312 my balls\" but this is even better 
Wait what's 1312 
Hmm if you're going to keep one in person event why make it the one where everyone has to unmask? 
Is the lunch outdoors? 
okay go bears but have they SEEN Evans. There's no way. Forbes must be green-colorblind 
idk I'm here from anna 
this is true, I'm def better off, but also smh I've never both wanted and not wanted to be in a club more 
wait you guys are getting spam in twitter DMs? :( 
see the thread above, there wasn't one - we adopted the Portuguese word, but kept the old Sanskrit word for a generic root vegetable as the word for \"potato\" 
it's really not 
pranshu i don't think that's how etymology works 
yeah but if that were dominant we'd have a Persian word for tomato too, and we don't 
but why did the Persian word stick and not the Portuguese one 
says to tag 
I got tagged in this on Facebook, and I can't actually figure out why. As far as I can tell, potatoes and tomatoes were both brought over to India by Portuguese traders in the 16th-17th century, but \"tamatar\" got adopted as a loan word whereas \"aloo\" came from...where? 
RTing so it gets picked up by the academic chatter account #AcademicTwitter #AcademicChatter 
I've spent four years in Berkeley thinking exactly this, but I was always too afraid to say it 
I had my share of that too - he was just getting creative with it this one time 
cat butthole in my camera the instant i joined a meeting 
you'd appreciate 
Can't believe you're calling me out like this 
it's the Dora the Explorer effect 
And when we're there, we'll have picked up the skills we need to be really good at our part of it. Along with research work, that's what motivates me to get really good at teaching now - this is training for the dream of being able to connect with millions and help or save lives. 
So we may decide to more directly work on these problems later, either in our careers or on our own time - like all the mechanical engineers and 3D printing hobbyists who designed and built ventilators and PPE in the early stages of COVID! 
But as said above we're not personally culpable, and solutions will only come from all of us bringing different skills to the table! Astronomers incidentally acquire tons of relevant expertise (fluids, atmospheres, general simulations/working with data and instruments) 
I'm in the Bay Area and we had two days of completely red skies and 200+ AQI due to the fires last year - I was in the middle of an online research meeting, and after it was over I was overwhelmed with the idea that \"the sky is on fire and all I'm doing is looking at stars??\" 
I know this is a joke but it's legit one of my fav textbooks I've ever had for a class, has exactly what you need and is super clear 
I know this is a meme but: stuff like organizing paths and data (eg timestamping), writing code for reproducibility, commenting, could probably fall under this! And having just spent the morning scouring a codebase for accidental bad file deletions, I'd call that pretty essential 
Error messages are fun sometimes 
Also when. I'd love to imagine it's either, like, sophomore year/first time running a kitchen, or last week 
That's so tragic why did he live like that 
I actually had this! I first got the nice clicky switch, then got a case soon after with the actual switch so my clicky one didn't do anything but felt cool 
The trial and crucifixion were just nat 1s on persuasion change my mind 
so true 
oo wanna share the story? 
something something monte carlo 
No wonder the \"infinite_cards\" project only made it 0.0% of the way through 
Oo learned a new word 
Wait what's his ideology beyond \"forests good\" 
I always think \"SF ice cream sandwich pronouns\" tbh 
oh wow I have been overtaken 
as an early career astronomer it's a little scary to see a bunch of replies saying this is relatable 
I'm aspiring to be a Julia shitposter I just don't know how 
Wait you're telling me I've been seeing non-horny Anna up to this point? 
I just used this yesterday! V cool 
Honestly I'm intruding on her territory here, I stayed off it for years 
Also you weren't supposed to find out that that's how I packed 
we're supposed to take different halves of the app! I'm not doing education policy here am i 
I kinda just threw together everything I could fit into two suitcases and it's been fine so far tbh 
I was reminded of this for some reason 
Jk it's experimental I'll be in hell for months 
Pray for mine to be similarly short lmao 
Woah that was quick 
Brb auditioning for UC and then coauthoring a paper w you 
And I'm proud to say it! 
you can Fourier transform a crystal 
I mean the whole premise is dumb but even if you accept it, 22 = too late to be married is some...outdated thinking to say the least 
1998 is way too late for this range to end lmao 
aw sad bc i'm fine w my display name, but still cool! 
oh wait it's display name not this thing? 
WAIT HOW 
Yay it's so good! Can't recommend enough 
doesn't that mean I'm more likely to understand what's up with Neville 
yeah, feels terrifyingly close though 
tang strikes me as, like, the first thing that should go in person right 
excellent choice 
That's much nicer than any of the reasons I've ever cried in downtown berkeley 
I read this yesterday and am now very apprehensive about ever going back 
Love to live in 1958 
It's a rough day for sure :( I especially can't get the threat to visa status out of my mind - it was terrifying when the Trump admin threatened intl student deportations for only a couple weeks, I can't imagine having it hang over your head from your supervisor all the time 
nah too crazy, let's just keep threatening to deport our international students instead, that sounds easier 
also love that some of them have or are on track to get incredible lifelong job security! 
i KNEW that wasn't all photoshop 
This person offered me what would've been my second ever undergrad research position, and I might've taken it if I hadn't been warned by a friend. So sorry to hear all this, but also terrified as I imagine what would have happened... 
I'm so confused about whether you actually live with tal or if it's just an extended bit

I had reverse jet lag too! It's kinda fun, I like early mornings here 
okay but my question is who 
fair, this is the problem with letting bits take on a life of their own 
Yes the alphabet goes LGBTQIACDEF... because in this household we speak with pride 
astonished at how in 2021 men online are just learning about the concept of lesbianism. it's the first letter! 
gm anna i see it's just a normal day 
(uk joke pls ignore) 
wow the supermarket himself! 
I used to live in a house with a ~15ft hedge of holly (spiky, hurts) all around the front, made me feel pretty secure tbh 
i'm seeing this at 1am and it definitely feels like 1am-posting 
Healthcare in general, or yours? 
Rip what's up 
This is like the science version of the \"how old is x\" meme 
yeah, worse 
numpy be like 
Rip are there ducks there 
you're up 
I'm def not a fan of feeling like I always have to be doing n+1 things, which I think is pretty common in research and is how I've kinda always felt 
i think the joke in that case was the context in which you were gonna yell out \"trans rights bitch\" tho? idk who remembers 
the nickname shown for is an amalgam of like five different jokes that neither of us remembers now 
scenes from the writing factory 
yeah I've been reading this and thinking, aren't ultrasounds usually less invasive? 
This sounds like the worst thing I've ever heard wow\n(also what's সেলুকস? i'm not great at reading Bangla rn!) 
oh my god blackmail works 
ah another classic! 
gonna take a wild guess and say you're taking 61c rn 
hell yea 👀 
so true 
how bout me 
as someone who is also British and has spent time in America: solidarity, but also this is entirely fair 
ah, the Cat Activated Eyes 
need another MacKenzie Scott moment 
smh you didn't even leave enough time for me to get in a \"don't tell me what to do\" 
I just sent the news to my friends w the caption \"love is dead :(\" so glad someone else understands 
this reads like a dril tweet 
wait the second half of that is already the No U-Turn Sampler 
no no no i can't do this a second time 
It's one of my most vivid memories ever 
I had one of these for the first time my third year in college, and my IMMEDIATE reaction was \"this is the greatest invention ever. who could've even thought of this. I love america\" 
I love one-line code tricks! One that's only tangentially related but v cool is this 3blue1brown that implements a hamming code for error correction in one line 
As a current prospective grad, I kind of feel unsure about what the right thing to do is here, because I know opinions vary a lot - I tend to only email if I've got specific questions about the group/institution, or if there's a connection already via my advisors 
you're in her dms and can only tell the truth, i'm in her dms and can only lie, which way leads out of her dms 
oh interesting mind if I ask what they are 
Optical propagation sim code: 500ms\nReal-life optics: 0.2ms (basically instant but there's hardware limitations)\nEvery so often I'm amazed at how fast nature is at taking Fourier transforms 
nothing to do at all with nationwide food shortages, we just decided we didn't need it! 
Yeah what if I waited till 3am and then put this tweet out there as an alibi 🤔 
wait also girlboss hours 
As far as I'm concerned only you and I are above suspicion because it happened 3-5am our times 
There's too many :)s tho, it feels like someone exaggerating a few of her personality traits. I'm still 80% sure it's Anna but other close mutuals are also suspect 
I tried to sum up what this was about, but it's too multifaceted and awe-inspiring so I'll just say...I *need* everyone I know to watch this 
nice I support this 
are you looking for a new or 
Oh wow I didn't just dream that 
Ah yes the ovid vaccine, for when I want to be immune to roman poetry 
Another way is to say df_dx = gradient(t -&gt; f(t, y), x)!

it's voice-only recognition 
ty for the description because without it I didn't actually know who was who lmao 
I forgot that that was...a whole entire actual movie they made...with a sequel 
to clarify, i volunteer as tribute 
or excellent for productivity, maybe 
love to live in england 
I feel like just from following you I understand everything about Novack despite never having been to Dartmouth 
!!! this was so cool when I first learned it! obligatory plug for Purcell's E&amp;M, my fav textbook to date 
I didn't even try for when I enrolled bc I figured I wouldn't get it (also because \"adiastra\" as an official email was too good to pass up) and then I tried adding it as an alias junior year and it worked 
also fr if you want help or solidarity I'm here! 
this is mine, at least 
i've got it, it's: slept well because i've started grad applications 
I invested more time than I should've into making my own preamble from scratch, then putting it into a custom .cls and .sty - it's actually really paid off, at least until I had to start using journal templates lol 
also here's some deer I saw yesterday! The royal parks website says this is either red or fallow + we found a pure white one too! 
so after a bunch of googling I don't think the muntjac deer are around where I am rn (Twickenham) which is why they all looked the same. Now I wanna see a muntjac in person 
This bit is getting a lil creepy ngl 
Woah I never knew american deer were different! I'm having this same realization but in reverse lmao 
(I had a pedagogy class too but as far as I remember they didn't say this) 
Oh interesting, I figured you'd learn better just as a consequence of liking a certain style more? I was very conscious when TAing to present a few different intuitive pictures of everything mostly because I thought I should cater to learning styles 
Oh no F 
I'll be honest I feel like I'd like it if I understood it, but that's more of a me thing 
Lemon cake! It's the recipe with a few substitutions, turned out great! 
from yourself?? 
okay a gigantic planet sized lens and a gigantic planet sized lens cloth (or at that scale more likely little cleaning robots) 
also just a gigantic planet sized lens. I want my optical EHT :( 
wait yes. this is the ultimate stellar rollercoaster 
Idk why you need the high speed rail except for the vibes associated with zooming into the star 
A Dyson sphere but around a star + planet system with high speed rail between them 
sorry it's late and I'm indulging in being born-again British (complaining) 
can't believe we're experiencing shortages of literally everything and what the opposition is giving us is \"hey do you want more police state stuff\" 
tbh those three together perfectly fit the Labour bill of threading the line so perfectly that no one is happy 
I don't understand these hyperfunctional people sometimes 
i mean, it might be, idk my handwriting is too bad 
but also not BLM I'm so confused 
at least he doesn't support the police?? 
How lovely 
Oh hey you found the weird men again! ...W?? 
anyway this tweet had a similar effect and caused me to fix my posture so ty 
In my pedagogy class we had to do 3-minute presentations on any topic, and the one I still remember was someone who used their time to talk us through how to fix our posture right then and there 
I'd like to do the latter, but more often if I get started with one thing and it's going well I don't want to switch away 
Yeah but no mobile data, you could just not put your phone on wifi 
depends on how good campus wifi is 
\"kya AAPKE muh mein...\" 
In a voice that's way too upbeat 
as someone struggling with drafting a paper for the first time I needed to hear this 
ah ty 
wait I am also misinterpreting it the same way, what's the actual meaning 
Big fan of the new George trend of supportively ratioing the mutuals 
just use LaTeX and yours will become naturally superior 
I will say I have a lot more faith in SpaceX engineers than I do in Elon personally, plenty of them want to do good work and that gives me at least a little bit of hope here 
really wanna see people start to talk about \"yearning on main\" 
omg you're in the best building in the world 
you and both? 
I like this litwick (apparently from the manga) that supports your interpretation 
not related but I just noticed litwick has a lil smile! 
tbh spend half a semester there and you kinda get where they're coming from 
ahhh I miss this spot and every other spot on campus 
\"galactic britain\" we can't even get from calais to dover 
I have never once felt an earthquake even when everyone else around me has, and I'd love to keep it that way 
Did this as soon as I got a Twitter 
I'd go to that and I'd take everyone I know 
combine it with astro, make a nighttime only petting zoo. Cuddle animals as you stargaze 
becoming a youtuber* soon 👀\n\n*as a one-off thing for now but who knows 
do it 
also I laughed really hard at \"76 wasps\" 
wait this is genuinely so good? It's very up goer five which is something I wish more scicomm could do 
I like my workaround tbh 
Keep him under close observation till October 31 
Does anyone know what \"first grade class hamster rules\" might be? I said this a few days ago and realized I had no idea what I meant by it. (I never had a first grade class hamster to be clear) 
vaccines *are* used for vaccination to be fair 
I'm late by, like, seconds but go for ramen but nice 
(deleted and reposted bc the URL literally had my email in plaintext. very legit.) 
I thought Facebook was the Harvard-based Facebook? 
I may have left the bay area, but it hasn't left me 
everyone should ask this as if they're the first one to have this realization 
wait this isn't your main? 
very cool and easy one to start with: ham radio! Study for a few hours, take a multiple choice exam, and you get a cool callsign 
Oh you have split loyalties now! This'll be an interesting November for you 
fake news go bears! (as of 2019; please ignore 2010-2018 and 2020) 
not even Dean Summerwind? 
sorry I forgot you were on twitter 
Ah fair 
Wait isn't this your main 
you got any tips for aspiring planetarium presenters? 
this is very necessary physics humor! 
wait would that actually be fraud? 
he's screaming \"ratio\" 
wait I wanna see the source thread can someone link 
okay but consider, half rhyming hinglish slogans are perfectly on brand for India 
Help I'm becoming that person whose whole personality is \"I used to live in California\" 
Happy to provide content! 
Aaaaa yay tell me more!! 
That would only affect the last question though 
I guess you could also argue that you could have a partner's money as a safety net? 
both! (Or pick the one that's closer to your college colours lol) 
!!! Good luck!!! 
great tweet anna 
ah yes, here's the key caveat: much of this country still does live in 1856 
i mean, maybe in 1856 
you're welcome 🥰 
so true 
So it's microtargeted humor that went unappreciated? I'd be mad too wow 
What was the joke 
January? It's a (long but doable) road trip for you this year 👀 
How do you know it'll take that long? 
you have a WHAT 
I'm realizing this now! It was just the last thing I expected to see posted through my door in southwest London 
no it's worse! they're ALSO still exponents sometimes :) 
people are saying black holes are what now 
all three diagonals of a hexagon, like this 
it's kinda weird to get to a point in my mathematical education where I can ask for an example and the answer is \"all of group theory\" 
I'm v invested in this, hope it works out!!! 
hi idk what the feud is about but I'm here 
I literally had to spoil the show for myself so I wouldn't, like, die of panic 
If this is the second most reasonable application what's the most 
Yeah but you didn't just go there for college lol for me this is, like, an identity crisis 
this is homophobia :( 
It sure has! Of all the things I miss about Berkeley, dining halls isn't one of them 
is this cafe 3 
no already?? stay strong 
wait professors need WHAT 
rip well good luck 
lol also I had a weeklong takehome before covid made it cool, got like 45% on it 
is it designed to run the full 10h?? I've had 24h ones but they're meant to be done in 3 
Will this make it better or worse? 
Tons of mind-blowing math, but what amazes me the most is - every time a root is moved around, Newton's method has to be rerun *millions* of times, but the fractal updates in real time! There's either some incredible mathematical tricks or some incredible coding behind the scenes 
is this the goal of staff Patagonias 
I love it without context 
wait aren't colors 6 characters 
is this a final fantasy shitpost 
The top reply is so beautiful 
sanjana get out of my brain pls 
Yup it does, and then the pseudoinverse throws out all singular values &lt;= 1 * the largest singular value so that's fun 
Count me in as the first tbh 
This was pre the face reveal so I suspect this has changed a bit 
\"Anna -&gt; every woman she follows\" I am deceased 
if you're curious, this results in the zero matrix 
every day I wake up and curse dynamic typing. I just spent hours tracking down a numerical bug that came down to me passing in True instead of a condition number and numpy just rolled with it 
which moon tho 
more in the series of \"george just trying to see something\" 
Pure art 
what's a more reasonable mistake to make 
i thought this was a rocketry tweet 
terf island reacts 
a bond movie is only a good date idea if you're there to mock it (see: 
this is how I realized it was 6:30pm and not the usual gm 5pm 
You mean normal people don't talk like this? 
yes it is 
Wait I just got a snap from you? 
as follower #11 this is disappointing but understandable 
wait I always thought your students were younger too, that's incredible 
it's yes either way I'm just curious 
like silvery-grey white or WHITE white 
did more of this in a qrt 
updated source bc i might as well at this point. today has made me a vim programmer somehow. disgusting 
if i were newton's method i would simply not blow up at points with near-zero derivatives 
ah it's the origin bc f(z)/f'(z) blows up (f'(z) = 3z^2 = 0) 
i wonder where that one missing point is 
wait I messed up the complex-ification of z2, here's a fixed version that completes in half the time bc now it's *actually* got only a million points instead of 2 million. same general point tho! (also a better success rate) 
so I tried this with one, a thousand, and a million points, and the result in the 2D case was...not fast - even more impressed now 
naive (but vectorized, in the sense that the only for loop is over the iterations) implementation - am running the iteration for z2 now and it def doesn't seem \"update this graph in real time\" levels of fast lol 
Yay it's been so hard missing the best part of twitter overnight 
wait did i miss a bit 
oh :( 
Rip is this a Brexit thing? I heard ferries are being delayed because of that 
Also hi isn't it way too late for either of us to be up 
I would fund that tbh 
Oh bio's a bit misleading, I'm an astronomer on a yearlong goodbye to pure math 
(I support you being a theorist I'm just contractually obligated to always reply to \"if you will\" that way) 
i will not 
Yes me! Although it's more because I'm in the UK this year and it's a long trip, I probably would've made it from California 
In today's progress update I zoomed WAY in on my lab's remote computer and couldn't zoom back out 
I've made it 
if you haven't seen this before there's a super neat approach with polar coordinates (or you can just use the fact that the gaussian distribution is normalized lol) 
try the definite integral! 
wait the bay area is incredible tho? what could they possibly want that they don't get there 
ok anna you don't have to live tweet it 
so true 
AWW I love it 
smh I came here to say \"apple kept the game the same with this one\" but I'm the third one to get there 
Oh no I was bragging 
Oh I gotta step it up 
nvm this wasn't the error but my annoyance stands 
today it's way too happy to multiply matrices with the wrong dimensions and let me deal with it five steps downstream, instead of just throwing an error when it happens 
I have no idea what this means and I studied it for two years 
you're half Californian already 
oh whoops, it's, uh, magic just put there to annoy scientists 
LaTeX is a \"what you get is what you want\" system and these warnings are saying \"you said you wanted x, the best I could do is y\" even if in practice y is fine 
I only roughly know it myself but: even if you can see all the content, it's put there in a way that breaks something about how LaTeX thinks it should appear, eg if a word goes past the right margin length you defined at the top 
love the coat!!! 
okay I want that fourth one to be true! 
gm Anna! 
huh i see 0 but I get the notification, guess the app's broken 
off topic but for some reason i don't see your likes any more? does my tweet above have 1 like or 0 when you see it 
missing the gm tweet rn 
idk this website moves fast 
it's an international conspiracy :o 
Hey I get the reverse! I always ask for no whipped cream and I get it 
AAAAA (haha cheese borger) 
also no tho you need to have *commitment*, do it yourself 
tbh you can probably figure that out as easily as i can 
hey my friend has a question for you 
little known fact: MCMC actually stands for Multiple Chrome tab Monte Carlo 
I found a reminder that I should be doing research inside mine 
that's so cool!!! i wanted to do calteach but never had time :( 
okay there's a followup joke here with radiative processes being called \"rad\" but I can't find it so just pretend it was really funny 
woah what/where are you teaching 
Right?? How dare they 
yeah cal does but cambridge doesn't :( 
I use this for everything, it's even one of my college emails (way quicker than writing out my full name) 
(adi)tya + \"ad astra\" (to the stars) + birth year because adiastra is unavailable even though it's been inactive since 2012 :( 
Wait what does 7a do 
(I just had something I wrote in like July break and idk when or how lmao) 
other lies: \"I don't need to write tests, I'll just build this carefully\" 
wait how much of this was the dream and how much was irl 
Sadly there's no *icelight\" 
i don't wanna unfollow but also it would be really funny if i did 
oo show us a sample 
gives \"girlbossing too close to the sun\" a whole new meaning 
important science time 
wait what did you do to land up in court 
\"the discovery of dark matter [Food, W., 2026] precipitated a scientific revolution...\" 
I kinda love the idea of this being your perpetual alt that's more popular than main, and in the future your students will discover your double life as worm food and be amazed 
granted that's not very common phrasing but still (I first wrote \"destroying oil pipelines to solve climate change\", which it says is irresponsible) 
I just found out that \"solving climate change\" is good but \"destroying climate change\" is bad 
I literally just learned about these two days ago. Understanding twitter jokes is now my primary motivation to learn more astro 
I wanted to make a joke about burning the candle at both ends but that's not what the litwick line does 
call me litwick the way im burning out 
I hate seeing non-mathrm derivative d's 
oh no i hate those :( 
nope can't imagine why you'd think i would've said that 
At the Northumberland telescope at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge! 
Yeah am I just making this up lol I feel like I have such a strong memory of this existing 
Astronomer friends, I'm blanking on something: there's a standard object or patch of sky that's been photographed thousands to millions of times and telescopes use it for calibration, but I can't remember what the object is or where it is, does anyone know what I'm thinking of 
hey that means your draft was good! 
you'd better be telling them yes 
no more cigarettes ellen 
for a second I thought you'd misspelled \"coup\" 
w the exception that the spitter celebrity I know irl is and I did the move in the other direction 
wait this is spooky that *almost* perfectly describes me 
John Death, Esquire 
bad tweet ellen (you got this!) 
hm why is that turtleneck so high (thanks!!! ❤️) 
Thank you Manav!!! 
Thanks Jack! 
you're not allowed to have a birthday 
Thank you Anna!!! 
Okay I just searched this and I didn't find the original song but I did find this Spotify playlist called \"pov: you're in the year 3000\" that does not seem to have the song \"Year 
it's WHAT 
Me too! I like not knowing until halfway through 
Two months after I leave smh 
tied second! 
we're on roughly the same latitude? 
My friend Aled and I made a set of lectures and homeworks for a class, called PhysCat. It’s short for Physics High-Performance Scientific Computing and Technology, because it wouldn’t be physics without a tortured acronym! Also, we’re both cat fans! Aled’s cat Nightwatch: (5/10) 
Computational physics classes exist to remedy this, but there’s only so much you can do in one semester. So I started listing the gaps: asymptotics, high-level computer architecture, numerical issues, Git, documentation - and realized they’d make a perfect class! (4/10) 
Physics students are often self-taught programmers, which means we have to learn a lot on the job and make our own mistakes. This means physics code is often hard to read, hard to maintain, and inefficient. (3/10) 
If you want to jump straight to the content, our course website is at and all the lecture recordings are at I’m a little scared to post several hours of me talking, but my excitement outweighs that! (2/10) 
Today I’m super excited to talk about, and share lectures from, the class I just finished designing and teaching as an undergrad as part of the DeCal program at - all about how physicists can use code as an effective research tool! A thread (1/10): 
but also: lucky 10000, go listen to it! 
I refuse to make any references that are less than 140 years old 
sorry maybe I went too english 
\"if I were a rich man I'd be very good at integral and differential calculus\" 
alternate concept tho: pirates of penzance instead of pirates of the caribbean, get incredible mashup musical numbers 
\"fiddling pirates on the caribbean roof\" 
pro tip: be a non US citizen, that way you're already ineligible 
That's definitely a bad take, but I don't think that response was at all justified? No one opposed his point, instead it was all about opposing him personally which 1. I don't think is justified and 2. won't help him revise his views 
I just forgot about mine! 
I just did a lab on nonlinear dynamics where I had to make a lot of these! Coincidentally, \"chaotic\" is also the best way to describe the report I turned in 
This will all be gone in 45 seconds flat 
Excited to go there tonight! Cc 
What's it called? I want to see if I can get a hold of it too (more out of morbid curiosity than anything else) 
on the other hand, this much commitment to nfts and musk is even more unreasonable so 
it's a lot of commitment to the bit if so tho 
yknow we'd be even more honoured if you would simply stop 
\"ask and receive\" ok but who asked 
I'm dying at \"so honored to be able to interact with people from “spitter”\" 
I can't believe you're using your tiktok power for evil 
- Andy Weir, \"The Egg\" 
you can fool yourself into thinking you know almost anything in math if you just find a *really* good set of notes 
nah that one's just zarina 
no I'm backing you up bc that means you have to apply to Lamat to find out, you can't just go there rn 
reminder that you're welcome 
isn't she in Amsterdam rn 
oh I interpreted this as you saying you're moving to berkeley 
that doesn't narrow it down much lmao 
I have a friend who works for Sandia and doesn't do kill! Is there anything it'd be helpful for me to ask her for you? 
it is Done 
on it 
curl of grad school is zero. there's a joke here somewhere 
math DOES suck I am in total agreement here 
I can't believe they got a promotion from an account literally called Business Plug 
happy supernovaember Sanjana! 
this is true, schoolwork has been my most effective sleep aid for years 
Did anyone ask you if the scar was supposed to be on the other side 
wow I can't believe there's anyone out there who doesn't know it's mario, not mario 
Hey me too 
I remember the old days of \"can I reach 10k tweets before 200 followers\" 
tbf at least there was documentation and examples but still 
no i don't know what a \"sg02ad\" is but it just magically solved everything 
the problem with computational science is all the super fast code is in bindings to C/fortran libraries, so you can get a 10x speedup at the cost of code that explicitly passes in tons of mysterious flags like this 
hi me too? 
OH he's correcting your grammar 
What does this even mean 
this sounds like the opposite of a problem 
lmao failed censoring (check out the third paragraph) 
what mountains 
or worse, \"we can only afford to do astronomy if it helps the military\" 
lowkey terrified that the decadal will just be, like, \"no more astronomy, we've done enough\" 
a crossover episode?? 
well, in the UK time zone too, at least 
oh yeah I'm in the UK too! 
that's okay! (the second bit) I am serious about helping, feel free to hmu 
deeply cursed, dm me and I'll help you after I'm done despairing 
Gun included? 
has science gone too far 
scheme is type II fun imo - valuable to have done it in the past, but awful in the moment 
oh it's THAT part of 61a rn, have fun 
hey Anna I see it's a normal evening 
wait is there somewhere I can see the eldritch triangle monster? That's how I first learned it and I haven't been able to find it in books and stuff ever since 
If you can find it you're welcome to it 
Yeah it's greyed out on their official discography :( 
I can't find it unfortunately! 
at the request of here's the spotify playlist! 
this is kinda the \"eleanor\" solution right 
One time I literally went on a five minute rant about it before asking the person I was talking to for their name 
had a great time at formal hall annoying everyone with astro2020 facts and folding paper cranes! 
there's an illustrated summary! Lemme link 
I've been saying \"luvex\" for the merger of luvoir and habex 
I've been there and that place is huge, there's a good chance you wouldn't even see this section much less suffer at all from it being there. If they object that strongly to even seeing meat, I have bad news about what most of America is like 
if it's so easy to write down laws of thermodynamics then tell me exactly where any individual particle is 
I agree! 
Yes I'd love to help out! 
time to infiltrate an observatory so I can use their massive laser for, uh, adaptive optics reasons 
wait nvm the plan there was to steal the moon not blow it up. disregard this joke 
not sure of the budget there 
what about group chats that span multiple time zones 
actually i take that back, i don't know who actually decides these things 
and yet, far from impossible 
supply chain issues at the astronomy factory 
it's also weirdly appropriate that the fate of astronomy for the next 10+ years will be announced on Diwali, the festival of lights 
I would simply move my schedule instead of moving TIME ITSELF 
omg did you hate the unsynced daylight savings between the US and Europe as much as I did 
i left a lecture a few days ago at like 5:15 to a pitch black sky it's wild 
wow that looks delicious! 
\"the proof is in 182 parts\" 
isn't it always tho 
oof what's wrong w it 
The C is for characterization and I haven't thought through the rest 
Twitter is generating astronomer-style acronyms now! 
p sure \"making irl mutuals this is crazy\" was the first thing I said to you 
guy who doesn't want to pay his workers more than $17/hour because that'd push them up into the global 1% 
mhm the thought that the sun could explode right now and the next 8 minutes are the last 8 minutes life on this planet will ever experience keeps me up nights 
it does! this is the backbone of \"multimessenger\" astronomy: when we see gravitational waves, we can look at the source with a telescope and compare the GWs to the light we see from it, and that's possible because they both reach us at the same time! 
ah no worries! It was just one panicked moment lol 
I couldn't watch the briefing and this tweet terrified me 
sounds recursive 
like that is someone specific but fictional 
fascinated by the idea that *not* liking a piece of media is a red flag 
that's more like it 
(im serious, stop it, this is a place for beef) 
aw stop it 
finishing my proofs by contradiction with the 👉👈 emoji 
oh wow this explains every pre 2010 paper I've ever read 
ooh the ones i know here are great 
song you've got on repeat rn 
wow your testing was symptom-free 
This is your most unrelatable tweet 
hi Anna and friends! This is nice 
only in the Bay 
down either way 
what happens if I, a c*s man, like it 
but also it's hilarious that she didn't even recognize your voice. Some impact your \"rudeness\" must've made 
REI sounds like hell tbh 
Every time I've been to the south bay I have thought \"I miss berkeley and oakland\" 
this sentence could be the prompt for an award-winning fantasy novel 
since you mention concerns, I'll just say that I am in fact concerned 
this reminded me of how nice tqdm is 
a maslow's-hierarchy style diagram of foundations of science with \"print statements\" on the very bottom 
dw she won't find out from me this time 
does she know you're twitter famous 
I'm taking a PDEs class rn and these are so helpful thank you! 
not sure what I have tbh, it's more fatigue/shortness of breath than a cold - but hoping we both get over whatever it is soon! 
ty you too! ❤️ On the plus side I rediscovered how nice naps are 
oh I have also been Taken Out by not-covid today it sucks 
take a nap 
ha way ahead of you I just woke up 
what does he have against griffiths :( 
oh hey GR 
would you call that...changing the game 
or I guess *feels* like it's from a totally different subfield is better phrasing 
I like that we can casually prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, which is from a totally different subfield, as a consequence of complex analysis! I think that'd be fun 
isn't that only moffitt? I def just walked into all the others (kresge, doe, physics/astro, vlsb, ...), unless they started doing it everywhere as a covid thing 
but Anna where else will white men have a place in academia : ( 
i would sign up for everything and back out later based on what won't be useful - you'll take the tests in may but you'll probably know where you're going by march 
I've done it before + had instructors do it and it's turned out great! Usual rules about slides apply is all (don't just paste paragraphs of text, etc) 
(I haven't seen the show I just know the congratulations meme) 
oh it's even worse than I thought 
I was trying to make a Newtonian/GR joke but was cursed with the gift of prophecy instead 
I wrote this out as a meme but then I clicked through and the replies are throwing differential geometry terms around so maybe? 
no see we got calculus right, it just turns out that the economy lives on a curved manifold so all the flat theory we developed is only true in the low-inflation limit 
spitter couples therapy? 
I usually think dual space, you set some isomorphism V -&gt; V* and it means the output of that - what else does it refer to? 
ty ty i was gonna go to another one tomorrow but can't now :( but i will keep them coming when i can 
fine 5 then 
wow he's so smart i should be more like him and do four phds at once\n(my parents are actually great about this and telling me to rest! it's just me lmao) 
eh i don't think you could make an economic system to abolish deadlines 
omg play me (untimed tho I need time for naps between moves) 
hate that my instinctive reaction to being sick is being worried about not getting research and grad apps done 
lavender, fuschia, sky blue! 
lmao me but in reverse. what do you mean it's week 6 I've already died of exhaustion 
the BJP IT cell out there in full force in the QRTs. Real \"it hurt itself in its confusion\" moment 
nice pun 
:( sorry to hear that - maybe get in touch w some unis' LGBTQ+ student orgs to help you find a good place? 
from what I've seen student communities are accepting! Media and timely healthcare are bad, but average people are alright (then again this is a cis perspective so idk if there's something I'm leaving out) 
oh wow I missed the comphet bit of the original tweet bc I just focused on cillian murphy. What does this say about me 
yeah hyped to check it out!! 
it's always acceptable, take it from a citizen himself 
just that I'd only heard of 1-5 bc I explore these on car radios 
oh it's digital-only, that'd explain it 
wait, there's a BBC 6? 
to be fair, it's very difficult not to be obsessed with him 
wooper alert 
This place doesn't even seem real any more wow 
wait I love the idea of an exact remake! I don't even want new graphics, I just want Pokemon names that aren't all caps lmao 
nooo is it bad? I refuse to believe a sinnoh game could be bad 
like, by definition 
sure, but I would've gone to school with average RKP goers no 
did you and I go to different RKPs 
pipes slap, one of my fav small things about Julia is |&gt; 
omg do you have bike access in Santa Cruz? If you do you gotta bike all the way down campus it's so good 
happy to provide content as always 
when not working, (nullpointerexception) 
cool list but I'm partial to this argument myself 
Spotify can't keep up with switches between podcasts and music lol. Congrats on the new cohost 
\"the only red white and blue thing I own is a NASA sweatshirt\" is an excellent way of describing most of my friends' politics 
join the dark side 
I just realized I got this from my GR professor distinguishing spacetime (lorentz manifold) from Spacetime (the place where physics happens), and differentiating them in speech by saying Spacetime straight into the mic and maxing it out to incredible effect 
Blocking Elon Musk instantly was the best quality of life decision I've made on here 
One semester I was teaching multivariable calculus with the phi-polar convention, while I was taking physics classes with the theta-polar convention. I hate it so much 
GP and gp? Or is that even worse 
hi Anna! Thanks so much for finding and returning those 300 lost cats! Sorry they scratched up your Ferrari tho :( 
if it helps I also hate mine rn 
I have no idea what this is about but I support it anyway 
\"y'all can't git commit to anything\" was right there 
oh boy 
fun* with time zones: I did a bunch of test runs of a thing on my laptop at ~5pm, then ran them on a Santa Cruz computer just after, at...9:30am. So the real runs are chronologically before the test runs in my directory\n\n*no one has ever had fun with time zones 
I think you were the connection here lol 
no cons do it 
My friend says \"cumulonimbus\" 
I think so too! I hope my TAs agree 
In the sense of - it's something I read about in books, and didn't really think of as a real moment in time. \nNo doubt in 30 years covid will seem this distant and abstract? 
I just went back to a lab report I did ~a month ago, and found out I submitted this 
Of course 
That really does feel like ancient history 
update: just spent two hours debugging something where the error was I wrote \"i\" instead of \"j\" 
I'm passionate about computational science right up until I start debugging something 
hey ishaan let's get dinner at 66600 
8+7 has a 5 at the end, and a 20 + a 40 + some overflow should be 70 so 75. \n(It's a bit vague and fuzzy honestly) 
I would mock you for this but you're in today's lucky 10000! 
i definitely am haunted now thx 
Hey it works for me 
I’m so glad I got the opportunity to do this, and to make a meaningful contribution to the Berkeley physics and general physics education community. I hope posting this publicly helps people as they learn how to code for their own physics research! (10/10) 
Module 3/3: real-life tools. What’s Github and why do I need one? How do I read and write documentation? How do I structure my code? I also got my students to roast my old code as an educational tool, which was fun. (9/10) 
Module 2/3: scientific computing. How do you know if a program’s fast independent of a computer? Why are for loops bad? How is probability used in computational science? Why are people switching over to How DO you get a good still image of your own face? (8/10) 
Module 1/3: computer architecture. How does processing and memory work under the hood, and how can we leverage that for faster science (Numba and CUDA)? Students completed a Python-based instruction set architecture, and accelerated their code on a GPU. (7/10) 
We’re just now wrapping up a successful 20-student first offering (of what I hope is many!) I’ll talk briefly about our three modules. (6/10) 
same energy 
i made it!! 
\"the established women in math never complained!\" 
Oof oh no but glad it happens to everyone sometime 
It's simply better than the rest of the bay area 
scary that the only reason I'm not this median is bc I just turned 22 a few weeks ago 
omg i just saw this, even the camera works! this is so good 
Up to speed again! Still feeling pretty dumb but at least I know not to do that next time 
Oh fair enough I thought you'd still hide the left thing, but I guess that wouldn't make much sense 
do it you wont 
hi! I'm in the UK too, we should get in touch! 
I'm being extremely stupid rn 
yeah this is a learning experience lol, I used to have Google Drive sync and that would've saved me but it's not working now that I don't have the infinite student plan 
(legit it's the only thing in my diffgeo class where I had literally 0% understanding or intuition) 
oh no my only weakness 
I really hope it's an academic rite of passage to lose a bunch of work you just did and have to redo it lol (I rm -rfd a git repo I'd merged somewhere else without checking for uncommitted changes and lost several pages of writing) 
i have since received a parental command to get it now lol 
it's true i was the uber 
if you wait ~a month I'm gonna get myself a Switch as a present for finishing grad apps! Super down then 
I'm crying this is incredible 
plus stars are pretty and those ape things are hideous 
they're just respectful of women in stem 😤 
I just love that everyone's mocking the gendered restrooms at a house party 
seeing this after having just committed to too many grad apps really hits hard 
\"Wink (other eye)\" omg anna I'm dying 
I remember always thinking to myself something like \"this would happen, (but sadly everyone involved has been eaten by bears)\" 
It was everywhere when I was going through CBSE English about 10 years ago, drove me crazy 
Outing you 
I'm in hour seven of learning the language and just totally vibing 
gitlet was the most type ii fun I've ever had - awful in the moment and so cool just after you've done it 
nah I just know how eecs operates 
this is ee16ab propaganda 
Worm Food,\n\nThis is how I'm starting all my replies to you from now on 
That is such a high res surprise pikachu 
considering something monumentally stupid that would be incredible if i could pull it off 
clearly we think alike 
hey this is my stellar class today! 
half of all the theorems I learn have the names of cal professors on them lmao. Like just doors I casually walked past in Evans 
hey grad schools I've got a pitch for you 
Clearly the compromise solution here is to make code open source, but so difficult to use that only the original developers will know how to do anything 
Not that you should be committed to that in the first place, but conditional on that it's less weird 
Okay but if you're committed to buying a $650+ watch, I almost feel like it'd be dumber to get the cheaper one on the grounds of fiscal responsibility lmao 
\"in the 20s\" is deeply disturbing phrasing 
When I get a cat I'm naming it Spinlock 
This is extremely cursed 
gin-and-to (nic on the next line) could work w the appropriate accent 
it's python laughing in your face at your attempts to do anything actually in parallel 
Well really it's been the biggest problem in my life for months but I only just found that out 
In three days, I've gone from not knowing what the global interpreter lock is to it being the biggest problem in my life 
Once at a dinner I asked an instrumentation astronomer if he considers himself an engineer and he went \"never insult me like that again\" 
incredible i can't wait 
ngl I'd love to see them try and write a journal paper. Watch as Quick Essay Services figures out what dark matter is 
It's even in character, I can totally see \"you have such a way with words\" being an edgeworth comeback to a phoenix failed monologue 
Oh what a beautiful ratio 
Wait are there laws against that in America? I've never heard of this but that might just be bc Berkeley 
i think for me it's that being on a direct train into London has big main character energy 
\"biggest fear\" is a *wild* thing to have in a fun get-to-know-you post 
haven't used this project myself, but I've used this structure a lot and it's worked pretty well! 
love the nail polish! 
noooo commiserate with 
15 hours?? Good luck wow 
Tbf a Cornell library isn't the least likely place to have something weird and ancient like that 
I missed the \"about books\" in that sentence and was absolutely terrified 
I'd watch! I enjoyed it last time 
long story, but never fear, I'm learning rust after this 
The particle physicists know what's up 
What tweets today 
ah one dollar per prop warning 
You should tell them it also causes a massive boost in performance if you train on your test set 
Like not as a meme?? 
I'm literally using a book BY (a different also-at-cal) Evans 
If no one's titled their AO talk \"smoke and mirrors\" yet, dibs 
Acab includes this 
I can't believe I saw this as a kid and was just like \"ah yes this is completely normal, please continue with the mystery story\" 
this has to be like a negative six sigma food event even for this country 
i can't believe you ratioed me with this 
what was with the chicken suit 
This is another case like the watch where trying to hold back a bit out of fiscal responsibility just comes off as ridiculous. You've committed to making it affordable and you're already revamping how the system works, just go all the way! 
Not in the stupid form (this was about learning Rust overnight) but as you already know, yes! 
but also I'm so jealous lol I set aside all day to write statements and got like one paragraph done 
hell yeah! 
how many's a lot, asking for a friend 
I bet there's also a Laurent series/residue theorem solution, set it up so all the coefficients are 1 and solve a system somehow. That's the most overengineered way I can think of 
Also got myself stuck thinking I couldn't actually say a involution has f^2(x) = x because we don't know what 2 is yet. Real Russell and Whitehead energy tonight 
Wait I missed the obvious answer of just solving x = x/(x-1) LOL 
when you add stuff to 1 it ends up bigger than 1, who knew 
It feels like just a property of the numbers so I want there to be a way to find it without calculus 
oh wild it's actually an involution! f(f(x)) = x, so you can never find out that 2 is a fixed point just by iterating a point away from it. Is there another way to do it without derivative-type information (like Newton's method on g(x) = f(x) - x))? 
although I guess that follows from the first term being 1/x^0 = 1 lol 
so f(x) = 1/(1 - 1/x)) = x/(x-1) &gt; 1 for x &gt; 1, which means you can't actually get the case I was worried about: the one where x is large enough that the sum &lt; 1, and you feed that into the next iteration to get it to blow up 
whoops n=0 not i=0 
How do you get the approximation to 2 that you plug into the 1/2^n term? I wonder if iterating the map f(x) = sum_{i=0}^inf 1/x^n enough times always gets you to 2 
I could not make this headline any more anxiety inducing than this if I tried 
going through all my SOP drafts and deleting the sentences that mention future JWST proposals 
I'm being microtargeted, I wish I could follow twice 
I have def been using \\Bat much less than I should 
By the Rollback Stones 
How does Ithaca just absolutely nail the best things in life? First ice cream now this 
Grothendieck said what now 
Oops I already can't stand to look at mine and I'm less than half done... 
is also pretty great! 
I can't believe I put effort into drawing this nice star only to find out the TeX for star is \\star 
Fair enough, hope it works out! 
Well only one of you has a cool necklace so 
Yeah but with the plan that you'll drop one early on? I did this a lot in ug 
wait is it a max of 15 as well? If not you could take 5 ug 1 grad and then pick one to drop 
can you try it for a bit and drop if it's too much? 
Uh rip here's the best I've got 
consider me Got 
what hall now 
I have a very weird cross section of places I learned to pronounce things so I don't know if this is English, Indian, or just something I made up lol, all I can tell is it's clearly not American 
it's not a very strong emphasis on the last syllable but I can tell the difference for sure 
I really really hope not 
ok I'm now officially too in my own head about this to even know how I would say this normally 
Wait have I been wrong about this for years 
Oops in this case I meant emphasis on the last syllable, so the verb is doc-u-MENT while the noun is DOC-u-ment 
interesting, what makes this case different? I've always said document like how I described, is it maybe a regional thing? 
Noun has the emphasis on the first syllable, verb on the second. I think this is a common pattern, e.g. it's also how I say \"record\" as a noun vs verb 
won't even bother with the hyping up 
ah yes,,, quality science journalism 
this is happening to me a lot lately 
This is like the reverse of me 
Happy to be shielded from this part of the internet 
this is basically a Cornell acceptance letter right 
that's what I've got lmao perfect outflow from the center 
You should team up with Anna on this 
simply staring at this and sighing 
Time to just talk on here instead of messenger so I can steal the top spot 
Kinda early for sad boy hours isn't it 
wait what'd they do 
it's the greatest thing American culture has ever produced! 
Hearing about deep fried butter was quite something 
The greatest day of my undergrad career was when my friends introduced me to deep fried Oreos 
Also just very good statistics on display. I don't think this is even a \"correlation is not causation\" because even a correlation needs two data points 
supportive ratio 
what's the base case 
let's go 
Also how is \"third tweet ever\" an insult and why is it something he's looking up. Why does Neil care about this. Real moment 
I don't have words to describe how stupid this is, it literally means something different?? Love to test solutions to the definitely real killer asteroid problem 
has anyone had to cite the python docs before? How do you put it in a bibtex? (Alternatively how do you provide a more academic citation for what the Global Interpreter Lock is) 
also the word \"prestigious\" now has no meaning 
many things to criticize but how does a cs major prefer Dubai to the bay lmao. That and the Berkeley slander, can I get a go bears 
it's awful I hate it too 
all of November so far 
she said \"wrong answers only\" 
Wait is it? Now I'm not sure, this is hard 
OH you meant something completely different, yeah for me it's the same sounds just different stress 
*stares in October scorpio* 
I have simultaneously never seen this and know perfectly what you mean 
i wonder if I know anyone else who loves this movie and who had me over at their house to watch it 🤔 
it IS the Sun so journalism is bound to be bad, here's a better source 
oh that is a Young sid 
plus the same three on shattuck for when you feel adventurous 
hmmmm wonder when you did that 
but you're already southside 
more importantly how'd you ever go there and not stop by to see me 
well nothing for it i gotta go back 
i lived literally two blocks from the 7-11 on telegraph for two years and walked past this place hundreds of times how did i never go in 
\"spupid\" is already a double contraction tho 
wait I've never been here 
la note!!! 
The worst one I ever had was \"Aam\". I have no idea how they got that from \"Aditya\" 
They really just left out \"ionization\" and absolutely nothing else from that acronym huh 
yeah guessing qso is quasi-stellar object 
wait okay let me try: oxygen-iron low(?) broad absorption line quasar (where I think quasar is itself an acronym for something else)\n\nidk what's low in it though, the amount of absorption? 
I literally don't even understand this meme 
parking and no parking days 
uh what 
wait was that the original joke nvm 
or worse, when you might run into bland food 
we're all our own worst critics! I've hated things about how I look in photos that friends tell me aren't apparent/aren't problems at all 
this is false the photo's amazing 
Getting into BOTW and I'm just blown away by the sound design. The first low note in the Guardian encounter music evokes more terror in me than anything that could show up on the screen 
Ooo lmk what you think of axiom's end, it's been on my list for a while 
It's like writing regex 
Omg you did the thing I said 
wait this is genius 
we're the spiderman: no way home 
This implies kids can be bad when they're not around the elf 
Ooh this is a high score contender 
POV: you don't know about linguist-documentation or you are an astronomer or both 
this is just like 1999 
Thanks Deana! Can't wait to get started at Santa Cruz! 
Thank you!! Go Bears! 
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
this is my ETA 
In this paper I will be there in about an hour or so 
Graduated with a bachelor's in Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics &amp; Statistics from UC Berkeley today! 
You were up for it anyway so 
Why are you tweeting get your head in the game 
st*tisticians are no fun 
someone out there has the SSN 314-15-9265 and they can't tell anyone 
i legitimately almost ended a discussion section with \"don't forget to like and subscribe\" once 
it sure is 
Happy to chat more about these! Zernikes are really useful but fitting with them can be subtly difficult (in particular they're the FTs of psf aberrations and not the aberrations themselves) so lots of interesting science I'm still in the middle of figuring out 
this tweet reminded me to take my gummy vitamins today ty 
here before this blows up (to 1e+308) 
Yeah I guess I meant it's only one sine wave each 
the o(rego)ni(o)n 
or did you 
omg it keeps getting better! 
Where is this incredible place. Kalman filters are half of my identity 
...i say, coming off work at 12:20am 
woah there don't overcorrect, we love productive rage but we hate burnout 
I did it!!! This is one of the weirdest issues I've ever had 
I've literally been debugging the dumbest python issue for hours (two versions of the exact same code producing different results, and the jury's still out on why) so I feel this in my soul 
TAd a data structures lab a couple summers ago, and my co-TA got a bunch of rubber ducks in so everyone could have one to do this lol. I still have mine somewhere! 
and its close cousin, \"assert False\" 
hire me 
it's really just sine waves, but there's something aesthetically nice to me about the orange plot here 
Did you make it 
you'd think people in this country, of all places, would know when something is and isn't tea 
aaaand all the fast trains from London to Cambridge are cancelled so that's my whole day gone 
unmasked man coughing on the tube opposite me. this is how I die 
Unless it's in the sense of you pick what goes into it 
Wait no you don't 
Oh that's a long thread, I thought it was 13 but it is not 
also why would you *brag* about paying for it? 
oh yeah and mathematicians are so much better huh 
guess I should thank for introducing me to the song too 
and 2-5 of the top songs, 1 was only stolen because I read Anansi Boys lmao 
spotify wrapped giving me zero surprises 
anything that helps wean matlab addicts off is good imo, we've lost a lot of good talent to it 😔 
woah that was FAST, congrats! 
Wait they also literally quoted Gandhi??? That's wrong in so many ways 
being shown an ad for the police, of all things, with an Indian face and name attached to it, feels...icky, to say the least 
I got \"record\" from that but that's about it 
I do in fact live in a college and soon you will too 
oo what's on the agenda 
wait lol I didn't mean coast I meant side of the Atlantic, there's an americanism right there 
I have the worst mix of american and british english lol no one on either coast is happy 
Alexa play the wall by pink floyd 
just scroll up and look at my take on this again 
Submit to arxiv! Also this is no joke the #1 benefit of being at a university, you get free logins to everything 
ah try now 
Can you see what countries? Wondering if the 2 is me before and after August lol 
The real trick is print and then \"assert False\" instead of a breakpoint 
same but add an ocean :( 
yeah for you to go to mezzo! or jupiter 
(I checked your follower list before posting this dw) 
you should count repeats with a sufficient time interval 
love the occasional confirmation that my mother reads my tweets 
vote Ellen! 
Wait you designed a programming language?? 
Ooo great choice 
um excuse me 
your top playlist is called \"bops to fight the big sad\" so that checks out 
Big think 
Who hurt you 
the duality of he/they 
Obsessed with \"people don't think about expense with X\" immediately followed by \"you find a way to afford it\". Surely finding a way to afford it means you're thinking about the expense?? 
at the risk of tagging well above my twitter clout, would agree 
go up to the roof!!! it's my fav place in the world 
:( but fair 
What happened lmao 
Shoutout to London trains for having wifi that's not quite good enough for me to work, leaving me no choice but to play BOTW 
ah yes SAT scores, the most accurate way of judging someone's astrophysics credentials 
Got this answer (with the caveat \"I might just be making this up\") 
at a guess I think \"some\" means about 50% 
got me to binge HIMYM during grad app season and I feel similarly 
Bring it on 
I would love to be told this 
Off the top of my head I'd say calculate the minimum separation between distinct targets in each catalog individually? 
Does this have the whole Hozier album on here (not that that's a problem it's great) 
I don't understand why they're all so ugly? At least make your art worth the environmental damage ya know 
well, you say tomato 
You're stronger than me then! It did nothing for me but provoke anxiety lol 
wait he retired? 
don't even joke about it 
don't you dare 
\"if you ratio a professor they have to let you into their grad program\" as the new \"if the teacher doesn't show up in 15 minutes you're legally allowed to leave\" 
i need to find botw twitter (they're probably in 2017) 
Obsessed with hashtagging blood 
me, 5ish hours into the main quest in botw: \"oh sick, a shrine in the middle of the ocean, let me go check it ou-\" 
did we need to know about it tho 
me neither ooof 
dunking on misogynists/homophobes/transphobes/etc who show up in your mentions with no apparent purpose in their lives 
just say you love everyone except men, we'll get it 
scenery, lighting, your smile, it's just all great! 
well you ARE american so that's half of it 
hey I have a YouTuber to recommend who could help with all three 
Not Fourier Transform 
math but swirly 
Wait what's your \"big three\" 
Just found this taped up at home from the previous occupants. Good luck to Ben and Maddie wherever they are 
I didn't know if it was open then 
ok at least add me (adiastra) 
there's a spitter and friends chess gc that started if you wanna join! 
REI, more like REturning here is Impossible 
normally I'd say Patagonia was an essential part of the bay area starter pack but you've one-upped that, nice 
oh this is so good! it's actually so hard to find good references for this, I've been on like 100 different websites explaining Kalman filtering + LQR and v few of them do it well or completely but this one seems to 
scribbling \"love is not a symmetric binary relation\" in the margins of my school notebook 
The real answer to \"is there life out there\" is \"not any more\" 
friend recommendation 
Some day I wanna hear about what actually happened with **** 
Ah right I forgot how twitter works 
Plot twist: I'm a deep cover plant from them and I've been working towards this intel all year 
Is it even worth censoring when both of us on here know what it stands for LOL 
why get an alt when i could just send anything I'd rt on there to to rt instead 
it's the Ben Shapiro of it all 
Oh this is amazing 
woah twitter world crossover! I thought only the astronomers were doing this 
This is after I spent 20 mins cryonis-ing over the water to get there smh 
I broke my two most powerful ones, got killed in one hit, and decided to just warp back lol 
just threw in a bunch of adaptive optics terms 
me too 
I'll admit simulink is good but that's it, otherwise the UX of Matlab + closed source + lack of speed or control kills it for me 
no like, what's the it in \"it's called astropy\" 
Matlab is cursed 
not sure what \"it\" is in this question lol 
welcome to the club 
damn i gotta step it back up 
I have discovered that the shame from this incident is the reason Ellen cancelled on ME four years later at the same exact place. I can't believe this has a backstory 
drag her 
Only if you're affiliated or physically there unfortunately! 
ah it might, happy to take your word for it in that case lol 
we're in the grad apps time zone 
is there somewhere non-Caltech people can see it? 
maybe the real heist was the friendship we stole from this reinforced and guarded vault along the way 
I haven't heard of this before but \"money heist\" sounds so dumb lol. As opposed to what 
In the US when I had a covid scare I checked three CVSs and finally paid $25 for a test.\n\nIn the UK, I can grab a free pack of 7 from an NHS van without even getting off my bike. 
anecdotally astro/phy classes have curves w 60% at about a B (ofc no idea if that applies to NC State) 
thank you Manav! 
i tried 
some day soon 
is...the first thing... something a lot of people say?? 
Wait this is so interesting, what kinds of things have biblical undertones to you? Bc I've rarely to never thought that 
absolutely fascinated by this reply. there's three \"points\", none of which have anything to do with the original topic. Perfect twitter moment 
I'm sensing a pattern here 
emailed, thanks! 
Reionization plays a lot of Selena Gomez 
I had a stupid idea and spent about 20 seconds executing on it 
emailed, thanks! 
M for manav 
any chance I know any grad students/similar who'd be willing to look over an SOP? I'm happy with it but just paranoid lol 
I'd do (astro/phy) and (engineering), and also (others) bc we have friends in neither of those too 
run a poll! 
(itar for obvious reasons, the pandemic bc it cancelled the one non-itar internship I could get in summer 2020) 
oof itar and the pandemic are a lot of why I'm not an engineer rn 
no prized for guessing what language I'd recommend instead 
most of spitter is actually engineers I think - there's a slightly different circle of astronomers on here with some overlap but I think the median member is an engineer 
plus lots of hpc python is wrapped c or cython so python scales better than Matlab beyond this too 
At scale it does about what python does but without any of the python usability 
since it wasn't burned in 2020, I'll say being burned is a bones year. It's probably actually a fair metric - how motivated is anyone to actually burn the thing 
idk what any of you are talking about it's 9am 
my hypothesis was right! 
if it's any consolation idt I've ever met anyone who doesn't feel this way about their old code 
wait actually when I'm more free I'd be really down to offer quick research code reviews/mini consultancies, will file this as an idea for 2022 
lol lemme get through app season first 
Writing docstrings is my fav form of productive procrastination! 
I just looked this up and would like to propose it as a year-timescale version of bones or no bones 
oh and also except white 
literally all of them except green 
somewhere on the backend there's a 100 - sum(options[:-1]) 
lmao at twitter roundoff 
wait you have MCQ boards?? is this a covid thing 
pre pre boards just sounds so dumb 
you have to 
i don't think i got the grant right but that was the idea 
it was something like \"twitter is wild, you'll follow accounts for shitposting and one day they'll just announce that they won a macarthur genius grant and are actually a serious academic\" 
this has been great for me! 
Oh you did it 
one of my fav moments in college was finding white cat hair all over my blazer 30 mins before grad pics...and 9 months after I'd given back the cat I was looking after 
I learned it as a covid procrastination thing! Forgot some but remembered this much 
proud I could decipher this without looking it up 
hard agree 
this is how I feel about *any* possible SOP intro 
Yup am looking at that now, thank you! 
That's right - I'm just in a weird edge case because I got vaccinated in America way before it was rolled out to my age group here 
At 9 months but can't get it yet because of the age restriction :( hoping it'll open up soon! 
hmu if you've got questions! I love talking to people about getting started w coding (+ teaching, time permitting) 
this is uncomfortable to read 
there needs to be a knock on wood option bc for the past several months I have knocked on wood whenever I've said anything about the telescope. Even in, like, serious meetings with professors 
I count that as a win because it means I have to spend much less time thinking about emails 
this has been happening to me so much on here 
yeah I think they ask this for things like tax purposes, so any not-married state is equivalent 
International students at many places actually have to pay more than domestic ones! I have no idea why 
ok BA is pretty nice to kids so I would've just gone with it 
this is so amazing!!!
